[0.04 - 2.30] [Negative] [bar  crawl  across  their  screen.]
[2.62 - 10.26] [Neutral] [And  thanks  to  their  dated  workstations,  our  poor  editors  have  been  watching  a  lot  of  slow  progress  bars.]
[11.04 - 14.24] [Neutral] [The  only  reasonable  thing  to  do  then  is  build  them  new  ones.]
[14.24 - 23.38] [Neutral] [But  the  PC  landscape  has  changed  a  lot  since  2021  when  we  made  our  last  big  improvements  to  our  editing  stations.]
[23.64 - 29.76] [Positive] [So  we  are  teaming  up  with  Asus  who  sponsored  this  stream  and  sent  over  some  awesome  parts  to  try.]
[29.70 - 37.34] [Negative] [I  like  the  AMD  Ryzen  7  9800X3D,  which  we  are  not  going  to  use.]
[44.30 - 45.24] [Neutral] [Did  you  roll  the  thing?]
[45.40 - 46.14] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[46.38 - 47.48] [Neutral] [When  do  I  come  back?]
[47.54 - 48.06] [Very Positive] [You're  back.]
[48.10 - 55.20] [Negative] [Oh,  in  fact,  our  CPU  upgrade  might  be  a  little  controversial.]
[55.58 - 59.98] [Neutral] [We're  going  with  the  AMD  Ryzen  9  9950X.]
[60.36 - 66.82] [Neutral] [That's  right,  desktop  CPUs,  like  peasant  consumer  CPUs.]
[67.28 - 79.66] [Positive] [But  here's  the  thing,  even  without  the  3D  V -Cache,  which  doesn't  consistently  boost  productivity  performance,  the  gamers  watching  this  are  probably  agreeing  with  our  choice  going,  heck  yeah,  AMD  dominance.]
[80.68 - 91.38] [Neutral] [But  the  content  creators  that  are  watching  might  know  that  video  editing  performance  is  actually  one  of  Intel's  last  strongholds,  thanks  in  part  to  QuickSync.]
[92.04 - 94.48] [Neutral] [Now  QuickSync,  yeah,  yeah,  let's  stand  over  here.]
[94.70 - 103.30] [Positive] [QuickSync  is  Intel's  branding  for  the  dedicated  hardware  that  accelerates  video  encoding  and  decoding  on  their  CPUs  and  their  GPUs.]
[103.52 - 109.90] [Positive] [And  it  really  does  work,  allowing  Intel  to  outperform  AMD  in  Adobe  Premiere  Timeline  performance.]
[110.22 - 113.28] [Very Positive] [And  actually  encoding  as  well  in  many  cases.]
[113.70 - 121.36] [Neutral] [That  is  why  we  went  with  their  Core  i9 -13900K  in  our  last  behind -the -scenes  editing  rig  upgrade.]
[122.18 - 123.12] [Neutral] [But  here's  the  issue.]
[123.44 - 127.50] [Neutral] [We've  heard  a  lot  of  complaints  from  our  editors  about  system  stability.]
[127.98 - 128.94] [Neutral] [A  lot.]
[129.18 - 136.60] [Neutral] [And  when  it  comes  to  getting  work  done,  it  doesn't  matter  how  smooth  you  can  scrub  your  timeline  if  the  system  crashes  on  the  daily.]
[136.92 - 145.78] [Very Negative] [So  now  that  the  Core  Ultra  launch  has  come  and  gone  with  a  resounding  womp  womp,  we  thought  maybe  it's  time  for  a  walk  on  the  red  side.]
[146.04 - 158.48] [Positive] [Besides,  the  9950X  seems  to  have  solid  performance  with  intra -frame  codecs,  which  we  use,  and  it's  got  a  potential  upgrade  path  thanks  to  AMD's  long -term  commitment  to  the  AM5  platform.]
[158.76 - 172.22] [Neutral] [Though,  it  is  worth  noting  that  we  made  a  significant  investment  in  editing  stations  based  on  AMD  promises  of  long -term  socket  support  back  in  the  Threadripper  3000  days.]
[172.26 - 175.54] [Neutral] [And  we  all  know  how  that  worked  out,  don't  we?]
[176.14 - 176.90] [Very Negative] [Oh,  we  don't?]
[177.12 - 177.98] [Neutral] [Some  of  us  don't?]
[178.28 - 179.06] [Negative] [Bad.]
[179.44 - 180.76] [Negative] [It  worked  out  bad.]
[180.76 - 181.46] [Very Negative] [It  sucked.]
[181.62 - 188.62] [Very Negative] [AMD  just  abandoned  the  platform  immediately  and  was  like,  sorry,  not  sorry.]
[190.38 - 191.14] [Very Negative] [Anywho.]
[191.38 - 195.80] [Neutral] [The  9950X  has  16  Zen  5  cores,  24  threads.]
[196.14 - 198.22] [Neutral] [Oh,  you  have  32  threads,  sorry  about  that.]
[198.70 - 203.82] [Very Positive] [A  base  clock  of  4 .3  gigahertz,  and  it  turbos  to  up  to  5 .7  gigahertz.]
[204.06 - 213.00] [Negative] [Other  than  the  X3D,  which  again,  our  productivity  benchmarks  don't  seem  to  really  benefit  from  that  much,  it  is  the  top  of  the  flipping  line.]
[213.00 - 215.94] [Neutral] [Now  we  could  have  gone  with  a  workstation  CPU  still.]
[216.18 - 221.70] [Positive] [AMD  does  still  have  them,  even  though  they  abandoned  that  particular  platform  on  me.]
[222.16 - 223.96] [Positive] [Way  to  go,  AMD.]
[224.06 - 226.32] [Neutral] [But  here's  the  issue.]
[226.32 - 239.96] [Negative] [AMD  has  kind  of  gutted  their  Threadripper  offerings,  dramatically  increasing  pricing  for  their  top  core  account  models  and  lagging  behind  their  desktop  chips  in  terms  of  core  technology  pretty  much  across  the  board.]
[239.80 - 244.64] [Neutral] [Like,  you  still  can't  get  a  Zen  5  Threadripper.]
[245.12 - 246.36] [Very Negative] [What  the  freaking  heck?]
[246.42 - 258.40] [Neutral] [So  if  you  care  about  single -threaded  performance,  which  some  things,  even  in  a  productivity  environment,  do,  then  a  desktop  chip  becomes  the  reasonable  option.]
[258.88 - 268.14] [Negative] [Not  to  mention  that  the  motherboards  for  the  current -gen  Threadripper  Pros  cost  about  as  much  as  a  desktop  CPU  and  a  desktop  motherboard  combined.]
[267.88 - 296.20] [Very Positive] [though  that  won't  be  the  case  for  the  desktop  board  that  asus  wanted  to  show  off  today  the  ROG  crosshair  x870e  hero  a  $700  monster  with  absolutely  everything  I'm  talking  five  gig  and  two  and  a  half  gig  ethernet  Wi -Fi  7  5  m .2  where  the  devil  even  are  they  all  okay  one  two  and  then  I  assume  there's  three  more  under  this  plate  right  here.]
[296.20 - 298.62] [Neutral] [Look  at  that,  look  at  it  go.]
[298.62 - 300.68] [Positive] [It's  got  their  AI  advisor.]
[300.68 - 308.82] [Positive] [Everyone's  hot  on  AI  features,  but  this  one  may  actually  be  helpful  for  beginner  builders  and  can  highlight  ASUS -specific  features  for  seasoned  veterans.]
[308.82 - 310.90] [Neutral] [We're  going  to  have  a  look  at  it  when  we  finish  building.]
[310.90 - 327.38] [Positive] [And  it's  also  got  support  for  four  NIMS  slots  with  up  to  256  gigs  of  RAM  at  surprisingly  high  speeds  or  up  to  8200  megatransfer  per  second  on  Ryzen  9000  series  with  not  four  dims.]
[327.92 - 339.90] [Positive] [Their  NitroPath  DRAM  technology  means  that  there  are  shorter  gold  finger  pins,  which  results  in  optimized  single  pathways  that  ensure  faster  data  transfers  between  your  DRAM  and  CPU,  as  well  as  stronger  slot  retention  force.]
[339.90 - 349.62] [Neutral] [And  if  I  said  the  CPU  choice  for  this  build  was  going  to  be  controversial,  it  is  nothing  compared  to  what  we've  got  for  our  RAM.]
[351.04 - 364.00] [Very Positive] [Asus,  because  of  their  whole  NitroPath  optimization  tomfoolery  that  they've  got  going  on  here,  worked  with  Kingston  on  support  for  these  specific  modules.]
[364.28 - 372.54] [Very Negative] [These  are  161  US  dollars  each  for  a  total  of  256  gigs  of  RAM  in  this  thing.]
[372.78 - 382.34] [Neutral] [Now,  normally  on  Ryzen  platforms,  if  you  wanna  run  all  four  slots,  especially  at  high  capacities,  you  are  looking  at  pretty  slow  speeds.]
[382.70 - 388.38] [Very Positive] [But  they  claim  that  with  all  four  of  these  running,  you  can  hit  up  to,  what  was  it,  5 ,200?]
[388.46 - 389.04] [Very Positive] [5 ,600.]
[389.08 - 390.56] [Very Positive] [5 ,600.]
[391.18 - 400.30] [Very Positive] [We  will  have  to  see  if  that  works  because  the  really  mind -blowing  thing  for  me,  here  if  you  wanna  get  the  installation,  is  that  these  are  CU  DIMMs.]
[400.30 - 400.68] [Very Positive] [Whoops.]
[401.40 - 403.70] [Very Positive] [Yes,  my  friends,  CU  DIMMs.]
[403.98 - 429.22] [Very Negative] [Those  special  high -capacity  DIMMs  that  AMD  doesn't  really  support  other  than  in  bypass  mode,  which  just  completely  ignores  the  benefit  of  a  CU  dim,  because  there's  like  a  CKD  thing  on  it,  and  AMD  just  supports  it  in  the  sense  that  they  just  bypass  it  and  don't  use  it.]
[429.42 - 443.02] [Neutral] [So  the  idea  behind  these  is  that  they  run  at  super  high  speeds  on  Intel,  but  then  ASUS  and  Kingston  were  like,  oh  yeah,  we're  gonna  use  these  DIMMs,  something,  AMD  something.]
[443.20 - 446.48] [Very Positive] [High  speeds,  very  high  capacity,  sure.]
[447.52 - 448.76] [Neutral] [Let's  see  how  it  goes.]
[449.30 - 450.16] [Positive] [Cool.]
[451.42 - 454.78] [Positive] [I'm  gonna  put  that  there  and  we're  all  gonna  hope  for  the  best.]
[455.26 - 460.28] [Neutral] [All  right,  now,  it  is  worth  noting  that  not  everything  in  our  configurations  is  changing.]
[460.56 - 462.52] [Neutral] [Our  storage,  oh,  where  is  our  storage?]
[462.54 - 464.90] [Neutral] [I  was  just  starting  to  wonder  that.]
[464.96 - 465.86] [Neutral] [Did  I,  uh  oh.]
[465.90 - 466.72] [Neutral] [Is  it  in  the  motherboard?]
[466.76 - 467.68] [Very Negative] [Maybe  lose  the  storage?]
[467.70 - 468.48] [Neutral] [Yeah,  it  could  be.]
[468.88 - 469.86] [Neutral] [Anything's  possible.]
[469.98 - 470.76] [Neutral] [Do  we  have  tools?]
[471.52 - 472.84] [Neutral] [Yes,  I  do  have  tools.]
[473.06 - 473.84] [Neutral] [They  are  back  there.]
[474.00 - 474.52] [Neutral] [Where'd  you  get  them?]
[475.06 - 475.96] [Neutral] [Ha,  ha,  ha.]
[476.04 - 476.92] [Positive] [Let  me  tell  you.]
[477.28 - 479.22] [Neutral] [LTTstore .com,  let's  go.]
[479.24 - 480.62] [Neutral] [Precision  screwdriver  set.]
[480.62 - 483.70] [Very Positive] [These  are  moving  like  hotcakes.]
[483.70 - 495.26] [Neutral] [Y 'all  are  loving  these  for  the  longer,  skinny  parts  of  the  shaft,  so  they  get  into  recessed  places  a  little  bit  more  easily  on  things  like  laptops  and  game  consoles.]
[495.80 - 503.74] [Positive] [a  stronger  magnetism  compared  to  some  competitors  in  the  market,  the  nice  smooth  spinning  top.]
[503.74 - 511.80] [Positive] [That's,  I  saw  a  really  funny  post  on  the  subreddit  where  someone  was  holding  it  up  to  their  cat  who's  like  super  suspicious  of  it.]
[511.80 - 514.96] [Neutral] [And  then  eventually  it  was  like,  and  like  goes  after  it  and  it's  really  funny.]
[516.30 - 518.16] [Negative] [I  can  see  a  cat  not  really  liking  that  noise.]
[518.18 - 519.54] [Negative] [Apparently  the  SSD  was  just  left  in  here.]
[519.80 - 520.64] [Negative] [It  was  just  left  in  here.]
[520.64 - 521.42] [Very Positive] [Okay,  perfect.]
[521.42 - 522.20] [Neutral] [Well,  here  we  go.]
[522.38 - 529.12] [Neutral] [Let's,  well,  this  gets,  Dang  it,  why  are  the,  this  is  an  issue.]
[529.18 - 536.20] [Neutral] [Oh,  I  see,  well  why  did  I  take  off  the  one  that,  anyway,  okay,  well,  one,  two,  three,  four,  there's  four  of  our  M .2  slots  on  this  thing.]
[536.20 - 544.90] [Very Positive] [This  was  totally  intentional  so  that  I  could  show  you  guys  where  all  the  SSD  slots  are  on  this  motherboard,  this  fine  sample  of  a  motherboard.]
[545.96 - 547.56] [Neutral] [Anyway,  parts  that  stayed  the  same.]
[547.72 - 551.38] [Neutral] [We've  kept  our  one  terabyte  Crucial  P5  pluses.]
[551.90 - 552.66] [Neutral] [Wait,  what?]
[553.00 - 554.18] [Very Negative] [Only  one  terabyte,  Linus?]
[554.54 - 557.14] [Positive] [Yes,  and  there's  a  very  good  reason  for  that.]
[557.38 - 566.10] [Negative] [We  used  to  have  some  editors  that  would,  you  know,  sneakily  even  upgrade  their  stations  with  larger  SSDs.]
[566.32 - 573.36] [Neutral] [And  what  the  temptation  was  at  that  time  was  for  them  to  dump  footage  onto  their  local  drives.]
[574.06 - 576.42] [Positive] [And  then,  oh  man,  I'm  just  making  a  quick  fix.]
[576.54 - 581.64] [Very Positive] [So  like,  I'll  just  throw  it  in  the  timeline,  I'll  export  the  video  and  then  it  doesn't  matter.]
[582.28 - 592.88] [Neutral] [But  what  happens  when  you  do  that  is  you  don't  have  all  your  stuff  in  one  place,  and  when  you're  sick  the  next  day,  and  someone  needs  to  go  make  another  fix  to  that  video,  they  go,  what's  this  media  offline?]
[593.70 - 595.88] [Very Negative] [Oh,  they  didn't  copy  it  to  the  server.]
[596.20 - 601.04] [Very Negative] [So  we  actually  go  out  of  our  way  to  have  small  storage  drives.]
[600.00 - 629.44] [Positive] [in  our  editing  systems  so  that  nobody  is  tempted  to  copy  raw  footage  onto  their  local  drive  and  work  on  it  we  all  work  off  of  our  redundant  and  backed  up  server  so  there  you  go  not  only  do  we  save  a  buck  but  this  gen  4  drive  is  reasonably  performant  and  has  a  d -ram  cache  and  all  it  needs  is  to  store  the  os  and  the  software  that  we  use  we  also  kept  our  case  hold  on  let  me  just  throw  I'm  actually  liking  this  tool -less  mechanism  for  this.]
[629.70 - 630.34] [Neutral] [Not  bad.]
[630.56 - 631.74] [Neutral] [So  it's  got  a  little  clip  there.]
[631.90 - 634.58] [Neutral] [You  pop  that  off,  and  then  you  got  a  little  slide  there.]
[634.58 - 640.10] [Very Positive] [I  mean,  it  feels  very  expensive,  but  I  guess  that's  because  it  is.]
[640.78 - 643.44] [Neutral] [So  we're  still  using  the  Phanteks  Eclipse  G500A.]
[643.66 - 650.80] [Neutral] [It's  not  the  world's  most  exciting  case,  certainly,  but  it's  really  easy  to  work  in  and  has  decent  build  quality.]
[651.00 - 653.10] [Negative] [We  don't  need  our  workstation  to  be  exciting  anyway.]
[653.10 - 656.30] [Neutral] [It's  a  workstation,  not  an  excitement  station.]
[657.26 - 659.24] [Neutral] [Oh,  what  are  we  doing  for  cooling?]
[659.34 - 662.46] [Positive] [You  know  what,  I  think  I  wanna  put  my  cooler  on  before  we  put  this  in  here.]
[662.46 - 663.96] [Very Negative] [So  why  don't  we  talk  about  that  next?]
[664.36 - 668.46] [Neutral] [We  are  still  using  the  Noctua  NH -D15.]
[668.72 - 678.00] [Neutral] [Again,  it's  not  the  world's  most  exciting  choice,  but  it's  hard  to  argue  with  a  great  air  cooler  that  offers  good  thermal  performance  with  low  noise.]
[678.00 - 689.30] [Very Positive] [And  this  is  a  really  key  one  for  me,  super  easy  installation  because  right  now  as  I  build  this  machine  is  not  necessarily  the  only  time  anyone  will  have  to  work  on  this  system.]
[689.48 - 694.16] [Negative] [Things  go  wrong,  especially  the  motherboards  in  those  thread  ripper  systems.]
[695.12 - 697.16] [Very Negative] [Those  went  wrong  a  lot.]
[698.32 - 708.74] [Neutral] [And  so  when  it's  someone's  job  to  go  in  and  fix  up  these  systems,  it's  nice  when  they're  working  with  a  retention  mechanism  that  is  easy  to  use  and  not  only  that  but  quick  to  apply.]
[710.60 - 712.80] [Neutral] [This  will  take  me  a  minute  to...]
[713.26 - 714.40] [Very Negative] [Where  do  I  put  my  screwdriver?]
[714.42 - 716.10] [Neutral] [This  will  take  me  a  minute  to  install,  though.]
[716.14 - 718.04] [Very Positive] [So,  Dan,  do  you  want  to  hit  me  with  a  merch  message?]
[718.86 - 720.68] [Very Negative] [You  don't  have  any  merch  messages?]
[720.74 - 724.54] [Neutral] [Is  the  dashboard  working,  or  is  it  just  because  I  didn't  tell  people  that  there  are  merch  messages?]
[725.74 - 727.12] [Very Negative] [Probably  because  you  didn't  tell  people.]
[727.16 - 728.18] [Neutral] [I  mean,  I  did  get  one.]
[728.48 - 728.98] [Neutral] [Let's  see.]
[729.08 - 729.60] [Neutral] [Oh,  yeah.]
[729.70 - 730.94] [Neutral] [Thanks  for  the  bag,  Linus.]
[731.06 - 733.34] [Neutral] [I  will  use  it  until  it  falls  apart  or  blows  up.]
[733.70 - 734.22] [Neutral] [Huh.]
[734.94 - 739.78] [Neutral] [Well,  hopefully,  neither  of  those  things  will  happen.]
[739.66 - 761.50] [Neutral] [But  if  one  of  them  does,  I  hope  your  bag  falls  apart  Can't  wait  for  that  to  be  clipped  out  of  context  Anyway,  if  you  guys  want  to  interact  with  the  stream  the  best  way  to  do  it  is  with  a  merch  message  All  you  got  to  do  is  head  over  to  LTTstore .com  and  If  add  some  high -quality  merchandise  to  your  cart  and  when  oh  Does  this  one  come  with  the  offset  mount?]
[762.36 - 763.46] [Negative] [No,  this  is  an  older  one.]
[763.46 - 796.50] [Positive] [Okay,  we'll  just  use  the  standard  mount  and  and  when  you're  in  the  cart  you  will  see  a  little  prompt  a  little  box  to  send  us  a  merch  message  that'll  go  to  producer  Dan  who  will  either  just  push  it  up  to  the  bottom  of  the  stream  so  you  know  you  can  do  like  you  know  hey  mom  or  happy  anniversary  or  will  you  marry  me  or  you  know  whatever  it  is  that  you  want  to  put  down  there  for  the  LTC  fan  in  your  life  and  or  he  will  respond  to  it  himself  or  or  he  will  curate  it  and  I  can  respond  to  it  later  on  in  the  stream.]
[798.08 - 799.78] [Neutral] [Let's  get  this  installed.]
[800.86 - 802.50] [Neutral] [Oh,  I  could  also  bring  up  the  chat.]
[802.74 - 804.40] [Very Negative] [Oh,  where  the  heck  did  I  put  my  computer?]
[804.96 - 806.30] [Neutral] [I  do  not  remember.]
[806.92 - 808.20] [Neutral] [David,  do  you  have  my  laptop?]
[808.24 - 809.82] [Neutral] [Yeah,  I  put  it  on  the  table,  one  second.]
[809.88 - 810.60] [Negative] [Sick.]
[811.12 - 813.48] [Neutral] [Yeah,  Ken  has,  thank  ya.]
[816.02 - 816.96] [Neutral] [You  want  it  right  here?]
[817.84 - 819.26] [Very Positive] [Oh  yeah,  sure,  yeah,  here's  good.]
[819.42 - 822.62] [Neutral] [Let  me  just  make  sure  that  it  doesn't  have  the  panel  with  all  of  our  stream  keys  open.]
[822.74 - 823.90] [Very Positive] [It  totally  did.]
[824.22 - 826.82] [Very Negative] [That  would  have  been  extremely  not  funny.]
[828.26 - 830.54] [Positive] [I  mean,  it  would  have  been  a  little  funny,  but.]
[832.36 - 833.98] [Negative] [Hopefully  it's  not  like  a  social  security  number.]
[833.98 - 834.58] [Very Positive] [You  can  change  them.]
[834.60 - 835.30] [Neutral] [Only  later.]
[835.30 - 843.70] [Very Positive] [Well,  no,  you  can  change  them,  but  it  would  have  been,  it  would  have  been  very  challenging  to  change  them  quick  enough  for  it  to  not  be  a  problem.]
[843.72 - 844.26] [Very Positive] [Oh,  fair.]
[844.26 - 845.60] [Very Positive] [Well,  I  mean,  we're  literally  streaming  right  now.]
[845.62 - 846.52] [Very Negative] [Oh  my  God.]
[846.82 - 848.42] [Neutral] [Google  signed  me  out.]
[848.66 - 853.28] [Positive] [I  had  the  dashboard  open  earlier  in  the  stream  and  it  signed  me  out  of  my  account.]
[853.76 - 856.56] [Very Positive] [So  infuriating.]
[857.68 - 862.42] [Very Negative] [I  swear  it  signs  me  out  way  more  than  every  30  days.]
[862.62 - 864.08] [Very Negative] [Like  there's  no  way.]
[867.04 - 867.58] [Neutral] [Okay.]
[868.64 - 878.06] [Neutral] [I  am  going  to  successfully  type  my  password  on  the  fourth,  fifth  try,  fifth  try.]
[878.10 - 879.72] [Neutral] [There  we  go,  we  got  this.]
[882.68 - 888.28] [Neutral] [All  right,  motherboard  prices  need  to  chill,  says  the  Tech  Tempest  over  in  float  plane  chat.]
[888.28 - 890.34] [Positive] [Yeah,  I  agree  with  you  100%.]
[891.08 - 897.90] [Neutral] [Like  on  the  one  hand,  there  are  components  that  have  gone  way  up  in  price  that  I  kind  of  understand.]
[899.40 - 909.48] [Neutral] [Like,  yes,  Nvidia  owns  absolutely  some  of  the  blame  for  GPU  prices  being  completely  out  of  control,  but  they  don't  own  all  of  it.]
[909.96 - 919.54] [Neutral] [TSMC  doesn't  publish  their  price  lists  publicly  or  anything  like  that,  but  the  industry  scuttlebutt  is  that  a  wafer  is  costing  several  times  what  it  used  to.]
[919.80 - 927.74] [Negative] [So  there  have  been  legitimate  cost  increases  that  have  driven  at  least  some  of  the  price  ballooning  that  has  gone  on  for  GPUs.]
[928.22 - 931.02] [Neutral] [Clearly  not  all  of  it,  but  at  least  some  of  it.]
[931.50 - 936.66] [Very Negative] [Whereas  like  motherboards,  I  don't  know,  man.]
[937.70 - 962.14] [Neutral] [like  copper  is  obviously  up  10  or  20  years  ago  i  think  that  in  general  they're  built  to  a  higher  standard  of  quality  than  they  used  to  be  um  like  i  bet  you  could  build  a  pretty  cheap  motherboard  with  you  know  electrolytic  caps  all  over  it  and  stuff  these  days  still  but  nobody  wants  to  do  that  because  nobody  wants  them  all  to  just  explode  a  couple  years  later  while  they're  still  under  warranty.]
[962.14 - 967.46] [Very Negative] [I  don't  know,  man.]
[967.46 - 971.00] [Neutral] [It  just  feels  like,  okay,  yeah,  no,  here's  another  example.]
[971.00 - 979.54] [Neutral] [It's  like  part  of  the  cost  of  this  board  is  definitely,  you  know,  these  gigantic  heat  sinks  that  are  machined  out  of  solid  frigging  piece  of  aluminum.]
[979.54 - 982.62] [Negative] [Have  you  priced  like  a  brick  of  aluminum  lately?]
[983.32 - 983.96] [Neutral] [I  have.]
[983.96 - 987.40] [Neutral] [I  don't  remember  the  price,  but  I  remember  being  surprised  at  the  price.]
[987.76 - 989.36] [Negative] [It's  freaking  expensive.]
[989.68 - 991.14] [Very Negative] [Oh,  I  forgot  what  I  was  doing.]
[991.30 - 992.88] [Negative] [I  was  supposed  to  be  putting  this  cooler  on.]
[993.52 - 995.22] [Neutral] [All  right,  let's  put  it  on  some  thermal  goop.]
[995.78 - 1004.70] [Neutral] [Just  so  you  know  guys,  if  you  buy  a  cooler  these  days  from  Noctua,  it  comes  with  a  different  version  of  the  hold  down  hardware  here.]
[1005.08 - 1009.04] [Neutral] [And  basically  it  has  two  holes  in  it.]
[1009.30 - 1037.88] [Neutral] [And  if  you  have  a  CPU  that  has  the  compute  dies  down  at  the  bottom,  which  I  believe  all  of  Ryzen  7000  and  Ryzen  9000,  then  you  can  move  the  cooler  down  a  little  bit,  that  is  clearance  permitting  on  your  motherboard,  and  you  can  position  more  of  your  coolers'  heat  pipes  directly  over  the  hottest  part  of  the  IHS,  which  is  the  heat  spreader  that  sits  over  top  of  those  compute  dies.]
[1038.06 - 1038.60] [Very Positive] [Ow!]
[1038.64 - 1039.30] [Very Negative] [Oh!]
[1040.30 - 1040.96] [Neutral] [Shoot.]
[1042.46 - 1044.42] [Neutral] [I  need  a  band -aid  and  I  have  to  fill  out  the  form.]
[1044.54 - 1045.38] [Positive] [I  cut  myself.]
[1045.40 - 1047.56] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[1047.90 - 1048.88] [Neutral] [It's  a  security.]
[1049.14 - 1050.02] [Very Positive] [Dang  it.]
[1050.48 - 1051.74] [Very Positive] [Wow,  that's  really  sharp.]
[1051.80 - 1060.28] [Positive] [Okay,  if  Asus  is  watching,  which  I  assume  they  are  because  they  did  kind  of  sponsor  the  video,  this  little  piece  right  here  wouldn't  normally  be  a  problem.]
[1061.46 - 1071.26] [Neutral] [But  because  of  the  sheer  weight  of  the  VRM  cooler,  the  pressure  when  my  finger  got  stuck  under  it,  sliced  through  me.]
[1072.32 - 1073.90] [Very Negative] [Oh,  man.]
[1074.20 - 1075.38] [Neutral] [Ah,  you  know  what?]
[1075.38 - 1076.30] [Neutral] [She  might  not  bleed.]
[1076.30 - 1077.64] [Neutral] [I  might  not  have  to  fill  out  the  form.]
[1079.24 - 1082.30] [Neutral] [Anyway,  why  don't  we  finally  put  thermal  compound  on  this?]
[1083.16 - 1084.68] [Neutral] [Dan,  do  you  have  any  messages  for  me?]
[1086.78 - 1088.92] [Neutral] [Yes,  I  have  a  couple  here,  actually.]
[1088.92 - 1089.32] [Neutral] [All  right,  cool.]
[1089.32 - 1090.88] [Positive] [They're  starting  to  come  in  pretty  intensely.]
[1090.90 - 1092.42] [Very Negative] [Why  don't  you  go  ahead  and  hit  me?]
[1092.82 - 1097.38] [Neutral] [Any  chance  of  reviving  the  summer  jacket,  even  if  it's  not  ocean  friendly?]
[1097.60 - 1101.00] [Positive] [I  would  love  something  light  for  dog  walks  in  the  sun.]
[1101.28 - 1102.10] [Neutral] [The  summer  jacket.]
[1102.10 - 1103.40] [Neutral] [Oh,  you  mean  the  UV  hoodie?]
[1104.16 - 1105.18] [Neutral] [Is  that  what  they're  talking  about?]
[1105.18 - 1105.96] [Neutral] [Maybe,  I  don't  know.]
[1106.54 - 1110.64] [Negative] [Oh,  they  said  revive  though,  because  the  UV  hoodie  never  actually  got  released.]
[1110.92 - 1124.80] [Neutral] [It  was  a  product  that  we  made  a  couple  of  samples  of,  and  then  we  found  out  that  we  couldn't  achieve  the  level  of  UV  resistance  that  we  wanted  without  resorting  to  nasty  coatings.]
[1126.94 - 1133.48] [Negative] [And  there  was  actually  manufacturing  issues  with  the  fabric  that  we  had  that  didn't  require  the  coatings.]
[1133.82 - 1143.48] [Very Negative] [Like,  dude,  we  did  a  production  run  with  the  factory,  and  they  were  the  ones  who  told  us,  I  really  don't  think  you  guys  can  sell  this.]
[1144.08 - 1153.78] [Very Negative] [That  never  happens,  because  apparently  the  sizing  for  a  medium  could  be  anywhere  from  small  to  XL,  just  because  of  how  difficult  that  fabric  was  to  work  with.]
[1153.66 - 1186.06] [Neutral] [so  we  are  still  working  on  a  sun  like  a  uv  blocking  hoodie  because  i  love  mine  um  and  tatiana  is  giving  it  her  attention  i  believe  bridget  on  the  like  so  she's  on  the  material  side  and  then  i  believe  bridget  from  the  fashion  team  is  giving  it  some  of  her  attention  although  it  might  actually  be  lisa  um  we  want  to  do  it  but  it  won't  be  until  summer  2026  and  that  assumes  that  we  manage  to  find  a  material  that  is  suitable.]
[1186.06 - 1192.28] [Very Negative] [I  am,  no  I  shouldn't  say  that.]
[1192.28 - 1198.24] [Neutral] [I  am  a  little  more  open  to  coatings  than  I  used  to  be.]
[1198.24 - 1211.74] [Neutral] [There  is  one  that  I  have  tentatively  greenlit,  like  a  coating,  in  order  to  achieve,  I  forget  if  it  was  stain  resistance  or  water  repellency  or  UV  resistance.]
[1211.74 - 1214.10] [Neutral] [I  forget  what  it  was,  but  it's  some  kind  of  treatment.]
[1214.42 - 1217.06] [Negative] [And  I  have  tentatively  greenlit  that  one.]
[1217.46 - 1227.72] [Positive] [But  the  reason  that  I  greenlit  it  is  because  it  was  the  kind  of  garment  that  would  only  be  washed,  you  know,  10  times  over  a  span  of  several  years.]
[1228.12 - 1235.12] [Negative] [Like  I  think  it  might've  been  like  a  jacket  or  something  like  that,  where  you're  not  washing  it  every  week  as  part  of  your  cycle.]
[1235.34 - 1243.96] [Very Positive] [Because  like  I  read  your  guys'  comments,  I  use  the  products,  I  know  that  you  guys  are  beating  the  absolute  stuffing  out  of  this  stuff.]
[1244.34 - 1250.90] [Positive] [You  know,  you're  like,  I  see  the  posts  on  Reddit  and  stuff  where  people  show  off  their  collection  of  LTT  gear.]
[1250.90 - 1253.60] [Very Positive] [And  I  can  tell  a  lot  of  it  is  extremely  well  worn.]
[1253.88 - 1266.54] [Very Positive] [And  I  know,  I  know  you  guys,  because  I'm  one  of  you  guys,  I  know  you  ain't  separating  your  delicates  from  your  cotton  stuff  in  the  wash,  and  I  know  you're  just  washing  everything  on  warm  or  whatever,  right?]
[1266.94 - 1274.82] [Neutral] [So  it  does  limit  us  a  little  bit  in  terms  of  what  kinds  of  materials  that  we  can  use,  because  we  know  that  you  guys  are  gonna  mistreat  it.]
[1275.32 - 1281.34] [Positive] [And  that  product  design  philosophy  has  worked  out  really  well  for  us  because  we  know  our  customer.]
[1282.26 - 1290.78] [Neutral] [Like  when  you  guys  saw  the  Project  Farm  video  where  Todd  benchmarked  our  t -shirts  against  other  t -shirts,  and  he  found  that  they  didn't  shrink  nearly  as  much.]
[1291.16 - 1294.82] [Negative] [That's  not  because  we  have  magic  cotton  that  doesn't  shrink.]
[1295.28 - 1304.56] [Positive] [It's  because  we  pre -shrink  everything  to  an  obsessive  level,  as  much  as  we  are  able,  because  we  know  that  you  guys  are  going  to  not  take  care  of  things  properly.]
[1304.82 - 1306.74] [Neutral] [And  that's  exactly  what  Todd  did.]
[1306.94 - 1310.98] [Very Negative] [In  his  benchmark  test,  he  washed  the  clothes  like  a  guy.]
[1312.42 - 1314.22] [Very Positive] [Which,  you  know,  makes  sense.]
[1314.18 - 1393.32] [Positive] [he's  a  guy  or  whatever  but  that  is  not  how  you  properly  wash  clothes  and  so  we  performed  really  well  on  that  test  because  we  knew  that  was  going  to  happen  um  that  doesn't  mean  that  those  other  garments  were  bad  it  just  means  that  they  were  designed  for  people  who  take  care  of  their  clothes  properly  um  but  anyway  i  i  got  to  send  a  very  gloaty  message  to  the  fashion  team  because  they're  always  going  after  me  about  like  oh  we  could  use  this  material  we  just  have  to  put  we  just  have  to  put  really  good  good  care  instructions  on  the  tag  and  people  will  totally  not  contact  support  about  it  falling  apart  i'm  like  no  no  no  all  right  let's  go  ahead  and  get  this  motherboard  installed  dan  do  you  want  to  hit  me  with  another  merch  message  yeah  sure  let's  see  we  got  a  couple  more  when  i  stream  music  using  plex  amp  on  my  phone  over  data  my  carrier  carrier  mint  mislabels  it  as  hotspot  data  have  you  heard  of  this  or  no  fix  support  is  being  useless  oh  wow  hotspot  data  um  i  can't  say  that  with  any  of  the  carriers  that  i've  used  here  in  canada  i've  had  a  problem  with  them  mischaracterizing  any  of  the  data  that  i've  used  on  my  phone  and  honestly  speaking  i'm  not  fully  sure  what  that  means  because  well  which  carrier  was  it  Mint.]
[1393.64 - 1394.16] [Neutral] [Mint.]
[1394.22 - 1394.94] [Very Negative] [Mint,  sorry.]
[1395.02 - 1395.72] [Neutral] [That's  Ryan  Reynolds.]
[1395.72 - 1402.02] [Neutral] [That's  right,  because  don't  some  of  the  more  budget -oriented  carriers  have  separate  data  limits  for  different  uses?]
[1402.80 - 1404.04] [Neutral] [I  do  not  know.]
[1404.06 - 1404.94] [Neutral] [I  believe  so.]
[1405.02 - 1413.74] [Neutral] [I  know  for  sure  that  T -Mobile  does,  because  they  have  partnerships  and  stuff  where  there's  certain  things  that  you  can  do  that  do  not  count  against  your  data  cap.]
[1415.68 - 1416.44] [Very Negative] [I  don't  know.]
[1416.46 - 1418.50] [Neutral] [There's  been  a  whole  conversation  in  the  U .S.]
[1418.92 - 1426.84] [Neutral] [around  whether  the  carriers  should  have  the  right  to  prioritize  certain  data  or  treat  certain  data  differently.]
[1427.28 - 1434.76] [Neutral] [And  all  I  can  tell  you  is  if  you  don't  like  that  behavior,  you  might  just  have  to  kind  of  talk  to  your  local  representation.]
[1435.02 - 1437.50] [Neutral] [Do  we  have  the  hardware  for  this  case  anywhere?]
[1437.96 - 1438.72] [Very Negative] [By  any  chance?]
[1438.72 - 1441.34] [Neutral] [No,  I  was  counting  on  it  being  in  those  shelves.]
[1441.40 - 1442.30] [Neutral] [Ah,  okay.]
[1442.66 - 1444.94] [Neutral] [Well,  I  will  find  some  hardware.]
[1445.10 - 1446.54] [Neutral] [If  it's  not,  then  I  will.]
[1447.18 - 1448.84] [Very Negative] [No,  no,  we  got  this,  we  got  this.]
[1451.70 - 1452.30] [Neutral] [Uh -oh.]
[1452.64 - 1454.56] [Very Negative] [I  don't  see  the  632  bin.]
[1455.94 - 1456.64] [Neutral] [Uh -oh.]
[1456.82 - 1458.34] [Neutral] [Where  do  people  take  this  stuff?]
[1458.46 - 1460.86] [Neutral] [I  don't  know  why  people  take  these  things.]
[1460.88 - 1461.74] [Neutral] [Okay,  Paul,  I  will.]
[1461.98 - 1463.42] [Negative] [Counter  sunk  hard  drive  screws.]
[1463.50 - 1466.02] [Negative] [Yeah,  I  really  don't  see  either  the  M3  bin.]
[1466.12 - 1467.42] [Neutral] [Oh,  I've  got  the  M3  bin.]
[1467.42 - 1468.16] [Positive] [Got  the  M3  cap.]
[1468.30 - 1468.76] [Neutral] [You  can  make  it  work?]
[1468.84 - 1470.88] [Neutral] [I  think  that's  what  I  need  for  the  motherboard  anyway.]
[1471.22 - 1474.72] [Neutral] [And  then  if  you  can  find  the  632  bin,  I  would  be  wonderful.]
[1474.76 - 1475.74] [Very Negative] [Lost  your  mic.]
[1476.10 - 1476.96] [Very Negative] [You  lost  my  mic.]
[1476.96 - 1477.26] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[1480.78 - 1482.10] [Positive] [Yeah,  I  probably  leaned  against  the  thing.]
[1482.10 - 1483.10] [Positive] [We  got  band -aids  for  you.]
[1483.10 - 1483.42] [Neutral] [Sorry  about  that.]
[1483.46 - 1484.14] [Neutral] [Do  you  want  to  be  on  camera?]
[1484.36 - 1485.00] [Very Positive] [Oh,  cool.]
[1485.52 - 1486.80] [Neutral] [Yes.]
[1487.78 - 1488.72] [Negative] [It's  very  small.]
[1488.72 - 1491.04] [Neutral] [May  I  please  have  the  smallest  band -aid?]
[1491.84 - 1492.94] [Neutral] [Smaller,  please.]
[1493.76 - 1494.92] [Neutral] [That's  our  smallest  band -aid?]
[1494.92 - 1495.28] [Very Negative] [Oh,  no.]
[1495.32 - 1496.18] [Negative] [I  think  it  was  small.]
[1497.94 - 1499.04] [Negative] [That  is  tiny.]
[1499.14 - 1499.40] [Neutral] [Okay.]
[1499.50 - 1504.94] [Negative] [To  be  clear,  if  I  was  at  home  on  my  own  time,  I  would  not  even  put  a  band -aid  on  this.]
[1504.94 - 1505.82] [Very Negative] [It's  no  big  deal.]
[1505.82 - 1509.28] [Negative] [And  I  especially  wouldn't  need  a  team  of  people  to  apply  it  for  me.]
[1509.28 - 1511.90] [Neutral] [I  think  if  you  worked  on  stream,  you  wouldn't  have  done  it.]
[1511.78 - 1513.60] [Very Negative] [No,  I  always  fill  out  the  form.]
[1513.62 - 1515.74] [Neutral] [Yeah,  because  it's  not...]
[1516.30 - 1516.98] [Very Positive] [Oh,  my  God.]
[1517.04 - 1517.38] [Neutral] [Okay.]
[1517.52 - 1517.82] [Neutral] [Yeah,  yeah.]
[1517.88 - 1518.28] [Neutral] [I  know.]
[1518.40 - 1518.68] [Neutral] [I  know.]
[1518.84 - 1519.22] [Neutral] [I  know.]
[1519.22 - 1520.10] [Positive] [Show  me  the  owie.]
[1522.30 - 1523.36] [Very Negative] [Disinfecting  wipe.]
[1524.18 - 1532.12] [Neutral] [So  the  reason  is  that  in  the  workplace,  even  something  like  this  could  theoretically  lead  to  an  infection.]
[1532.36 - 1533.56] [Negative] [It  could  be  blood -borne.]
[1533.56 - 1542.26] [Neutral] [You  can,  however  remote  the  possibility,  you  can  die  from  a  little  owie  or  like  lose  a  hand  or  an  arm  or  whatever.]
[1542.66 - 1568.14] [Very Positive] [And  so  with  that  in  mind,  from  like  a  workplace  safety  standpoint,  we  have  policies  that  ensure  that  if  anyone  does  get  a  little  boo -boo  at  work,  we  have  processes  to  document  that  and  treat  it  so  that  in  the  event  that  something  really,  really  terrible  happens,  they  will  at  least  get  compensation  for  it.]
[1568.70 - 1575.28] [Very Positive] [So  as  a  leader  here  at  the  company,  I  feel  that  I  should  lead  by  example.]
[1575.90 - 1602.18] [Positive] [And  even  though  I  kind  of  gripe  about  it  and  meme  about  it  a  little  bit,  make  sure  that  if  I  am  injured,  however  small,  I  fill  out  the  proper  forms  and  do  the  proper  documentation  because  I  don't  want  someone  to  be  hurt  or  injured  and  then  not  be  able  to  get  coverage  because  what  WorkSafe  is  trying  to  protect  against  is  people  who  get  a  little  owie  at  home  and  say,  oh  no,  I  got  that  at  work.]
[1602.80 - 1611.80] [Neutral] [So  we  have  to  have  the  documentation  for  when  it  happened  and  what  happened  and  what  was  done  to  treat  it  to  ensure  that  we  can  prove  that  it  did  in  fact  happen  at  work  to  make  sure  they  get  their  coverage.]
[1612.24 - 1617.18] [Neutral] [That  is  why  we  do  it,  not  because  I  need  someone  to  put  a  Band -Aid  on  for  me.]
[1620.44 - 1623.46] [Positive] [I'm  going  to  tilt  this  up  so  I  can  finish  installing  this  here.]
[1623.60 - 1626.46] [Neutral] [Did  we  find  any  632  screws  or  did  we  give  up?]
[1626.66 - 1628.34] [Neutral] [Okay,  well,  hopefully  we  won't  need  any.]
[1628.40 - 1629.44] [Neutral] [We  may  not  need  any.]
[1630.44 - 1632.40] [Negative] [Oh,  I  might  need  a  thumbscrew  at  the  very  least.]
[1632.66 - 1633.38] [Neutral] [There's  thumbscrews.]
[1633.46 - 1635.12] [Neutral] [All  right,  Dan,  do  you  want  to  hit  me  with  a  merge  message?]
[1636.38 - 1637.20] [Neutral] [Yeah,  sure.]
[1637.48 - 1638.90] [Neutral] [Here's  another  one  for  you.]
[1639.20 - 1641.42] [Very Negative] [Why  don't  you  guys  edit  on  Apple  machines?]
[1641.82 - 1644.90] [Neutral] [Either  a  beefed -out  MacBook  Pro  or  Mac  Studios.]
[1645.30 - 1650.50] [Negative] [Adobe  applications  are  way  more  stable  on  Mac,  and  they're  more  compact  and  power -efficient.]
[1650.80 - 1652.98] [Neutral] [Also,  why  no  Noctua  Black?]
[1654.50 - 1655.66] [Very Negative] [Why  no  what  Black?]
[1655.76 - 1656.18] [Neutral] [Noctua.]
[1656.44 - 1657.84] [Very Negative] [Noctua  Black?]
[1658.10 - 1659.00] [Very Negative] [Oh,  I  don't  know.]
[1659.56 - 1660.52] [Very Positive] [We  like  the  brown  one.]
[1660.74 - 1661.28] [Neutral] [Yeah,  I  don't  know.]
[1661.48 - 1662.04] [Neutral] [Brown's  fine.]
[1662.36 - 1663.22] [Negative] [It  doesn't  really  matter.]
[1663.22 - 1664.28] [Neutral] [They're  editing  workstations.]
[1664.28 - 1665.58] [Negative] [They're  not  gaming  rigs.]
[1666.54 - 1671.30] [Neutral] [As  for  your  first  question,  why  we  don't  edit  on  Mac,  under  certain  circumstances,  we  actually  do.]
[1673.04 - 1683.28] [Neutral] [So  whenever  we  do  like  a  trade  show  or  an  industry  event  or  whatever  else  where  we  need  to  do  on -site  editing,  we  do  tend  to  travel  with  Macs.]
[1683.74 - 1685.84] [Neutral] [As  for  why  we  don't...]
[1685.82 - 1687.26] [Neutral] [How  much  tether  you  got  there,  Andy?]
[1687.30 - 1688.70] [Positive] [I  got  plenty.]
[1689.34 - 1690.20] [Neutral] [You  got  a  lot  of  tether?]
[1690.30 - 1690.78] [Neutral] [Oh,  look  at  that.]
[1690.82 - 1691.56] [Positive] [You  got  plenty  of  tether.]
[1691.66 - 1692.70] [Neutral] [Okay,  come  on  with  me  then.]
[1694.48 - 1694.96] [Neutral] [I  truthfully...]
[1694.96 - 1696.24] [Neutral] [We  have  a  lot  of  new  people,  so...]
[1696.46 - 1697.56] [Neutral] [Oh,  we  have  new  people?]
[1698.10 - 1699.08] [Very Negative] [I  didn't  see  anybody.]
[1699.08 - 1699.24] [Neutral] [Let  me  see.]
[1699.32 - 1701.28] [Very Negative] [Oh,  nobody  is  here.]
[1701.56 - 1702.70] [Neutral] [Are  they  like  out  for...]
[1702.82 - 1704.40] [Very Negative] [Hey,  Alfred,  can  I  borrow  you  for  a  minute?]
[1706.68 - 1707.32] [Very Negative] [Oh,  yeah,  no.]
[1707.32 - 1708.66] [Neutral] [Yeah,  no,  sounds  good.]
[1709.32 - 1712.20] [Neutral] [Okay,  Alfred,  we  had  a  question  from  a  viewer.]
[1712.38 - 1718.36] [Positive] [I  don't  know  if  you  guys  have  met  Alfred  yet,  but  he's  our  production  manager  guy  now.]
[1719.76 - 1727.72] [Negative] [So  they  wanted  to  know  why  we're  using  custom  PCs  instead  of  just  switching  over  to  Mac  because  of  the  better  stability  of  Adobe  applications  on  Mac.]
[1727.96 - 1730.18] [Negative] [You'll  have  to  be  uncomfortably  close  to  me  because  I  have  the  mic.]
[1730.42 - 1730.88] [Neutral] [Alright.]
[1731.44 - 1733.00] [Neutral] [Wow,  that's  a  great  question.]
[1733.34 - 1737.18] [Neutral] [So  we  have  used  a  combination  of  Macs  and  PCs,  but  for...]
[1737.26 - 1741.96] [Neutral] [I  mentioned  for  travel  we  take  MacBooks  with  us,  but  why  not  Mac  here?]
[1742.20 - 1744.90] [Neutral] [First  of  all,  we're  using  what  we  have.]
[1745.50 - 1746.98] [Neutral] [Oh,  but  we're  building  new  machines.]
[1747.08 - 1747.50] [Neutral] [Yes.]
[1748.46 - 1749.20] [Neutral] [So  we  could.]
[1749.70 - 1750.02] [Very Negative] [Oh.]
[1750.32 - 1751.36] [Neutral] [We're  open  to  it.]
[1751.50 - 1751.74] [Neutral] [Okay.]
[1751.76 - 1752.22] [Neutral] [That's  what  I'm  saying.]
[1752.26 - 1753.40] [Neutral] [We're  apparently  open  to  it.]
[1753.40 - 1754.22] [Neutral] [We  are  open  to  it.]
[1754.24 - 1754.74] [Neutral] [All  right.]
[1754.78 - 1755.02] [Neutral] [Okay.]
[1755.10 - 1755.68] [Very Positive] [Thanks,  Alfred.]
[1755.84 - 1759.50] [Neutral] [I  know  that  some  of  our  editors  do  strongly  prefer  PC.]
[1759.92 - 1765.74] [Negative] [I  know  that  not  every  application  that  we  use  in  our  workflow  is  part  of  the  Adobe  Suite.]
[1765.52 - 1784.70] [Neutral] [I  do  know  that  our  infra  team  would  strongly  prefer  that  we  have  as  few  Macs  as  possible  because  most  of  their  administration  is  for  PCs  and  so  most  of  our  processes  are  set  up  for  PC  but  other  than  that  apparently  we  are  open  to  it.]
[1784.70 - 1792.40] [Neutral] [What  we're  also  open  to  is  using  an  add -in  network  card.]
[1825.50 - 1825.50] [Neutral] [Sonnet  Technologies?]
[1825.50 - 1825.50] [Neutral] [Wait,  we  use  Sonnet?]
[1800.00 - 1801.28] [Neutral] [10  gig  network  cards?]
[1801.62 - 1802.16] [Neutral] [Why?]
[1802.32 - 1806.42] [Very Positive] [They're  technically  still  the  fancy,  fancy  Intel  chip  that  we  like.]
[1807.12 - 1807.84] [Neutral] [Oh,  okay.]
[1808.00 - 1816.40] [Positive] [I'm  just  surprised  that  we  have  new  ones  from  Sonnet  when  we  have  like  an  entire  shelf  of  X540  cards  sitting  over  in  the  warehouse.]
[1816.50 - 1818.16] [Negative] [This  one  wasn't  given  to  me  by  Infra.]
[1818.24 - 1821.86] [Very Negative] [This  one  was,  oh,  I  need  a  10  gig  card  and  I  went  and  grabbed  it.]
[1822.34 - 1823.16] [Neutral] [Got  it,  okay.]
[1823.16 - 1824.84] [Negative] [This  might  not  be  actually  representative  of  what  was  in  there.]
[1824.96 - 1833.72] [Neutral] [All  right,  well  anyway,  even  with  boards  that  have  10  gig  onboard  LAN,  we  use  these  add -in  NICs  because  we've  just  found  them  to  be  more  reliable.]
[1833.80 - 1834.72] [Neutral] [Is  that  true,  David?]
[1835.18 - 1835.78] [Very Negative] [Oh,  Dan?]
[1836.10 - 1836.46] [Neutral] [Dan?]
[1836.62 - 1837.32] [Neutral] [Maybe.]
[1837.50 - 1841.86] [Neutral] [I  mean,  we  used  to  have,  like,  fiber  to  every  station.]
[1842.12 - 1844.96] [Neutral] [And  now  we  do  10 -gig  boards.]
[1845.06 - 1849.74] [Neutral] [One,  they're  really  reliable,  but  also  I  think  a  lot  of  the  boards  before  didn't  have  10 -gig  built  in.]
[1849.76 - 1853.90] [Neutral] [I  thought  a  big  part  of  it,  too,  was  the  keoxia  or  whatever  it  was  in  the  motherboards.]
[1853.90 - 1855.52] [Negative] [It  doesn't  play  well  with  our  10 -gig.]
[1855.72 - 1856.76] [Very Negative] [I  can't  remember.]
[1857.18 - 1858.94] [Very Negative] [It's  probably  not  important  anymore.]
[1858.86 - 1863.72] [Neutral] [Well,  we  no  longer  remember  why  we  use  these  add  in  10  gig  network  cards,  but  we  do.]
[1864.02 - 1864.74] [Neutral] [So  there  you  go.]
[1864.78 - 1873.00] [Neutral] [This  is  the  kind  of  thing  that  happens  in  a  corporate  environment  that  I  think  a  lot  of  enthusiasts  don't  necessarily  get  exposed  to.]
[1873.24 - 1879.40] [Neutral] [Is  sometimes  a  decision  is  made  for  a  reason  that  totally  makes  sense  in  the  time  that  it's  made.]
[1880.10 - 1886.50] [Very Negative] [And  it  costs  so  little  to  continue  making  that  decision  forever  that  there's  never  any  incentive  to  change  it.]
[1886.78 - 1894.92] [Neutral] [even  if  nobody  who  is  left  at  the  company  remembers  why  the  decision  was  made  or  understands  why  you  continue  to  make  it.]
[1897.32 - 1901.02] [Neutral] [Oh  man,  I  mean,  there's  nothing  wrong,  certainly,  with  using  an  Intel  NIC.]
[1901.22 - 1903.88] [Neutral] [There  just  isn't  maybe  necessarily  any  reason  to  do  it.]
[1903.88 - 1909.06] [Neutral] [We  just,  we  already  have  so  many  of  them  that  I  guess  we  might  as  well  just  throw  them  in  our  systems.]
[1909.40 - 1911.30] [Very Positive] [All  right,  Denver,  oh  my  goodness.]
[1911.58 - 1913.48] [Very Positive] [Good  gravy,  is  that  ever  heavy.]
[1914.26 - 1916.94] [Neutral] [All  right,  let's  take  a  look  at  this  power  supply.]
[1916.94 - 1917.86] [Very Negative] [Sheesh.]
[1918.34 - 1922.58] [Positive] [This  is  the  ROG4  1200  watt  Platinum  3.]
[1923.00 - 1926.12] [Neutral] [It  is  $515.]
[1926.76 - 1940.52] [Very Positive] [So  full  honesty,  this  stream  is  sponsored  by  ASUS,  but  this  is  probably  more  than  I  would  spend  on  a  power  supply  for  a  run  of  the  mill  video  editing  workstation.]
[1940.94 - 1958.90] [Very Positive] [However,  it  is  jam  packed  full  of  features  that  Asus  would  like  me  to  tell  you  about,  including  their  GAN  MOSFET,  which  Asus  claims  offers  30 %  more  power  efficiency,  their  GPU -first  voltage  sensing  with  a  patented  intelligent  voltage  stabilizer,  their  magnetic  OLED  display.]
[1959.76 - 1960.86] [Neutral] [Magnetic  OLED  display.]
[1960.86 - 1962.20] [Very Negative] [Are  you  guys  even  serious  right  now?]
[1962.86 - 1963.58] [Very Negative] [Oh  my  God.]
[1963.58 - 1964.18] [Very Negative] [Oh  my  God.]
[1964.76 - 1965.50] [Very Negative] [Oh  my.]
[1966.04 - 1967.00] [Neutral] [Okay,  I  figured  out  why.]
[1967.12 - 1968.20] [Neutral] [I  figured  out  why.]
[1969.80 - 1972.58] [Neutral] [It's  so  you  can  put  it  on  either  side.]
[1972.60 - 1973.62] [Very Positive] [That's  so  smart.]
[1973.82 - 1984.92] [Neutral] [So  you  can  have  your  OLED  display  and  eat  it  too,  depending  on  whether  you  want  your  fan  oriented  down  or  oriented  up.]
[1985.48 - 1991.66] [Neutral] [I'm  going  to  go  with  fan  oriented  down  because  I  believe,  yes,  this  case  has  a  filtered  bottom  intake.]
[1991.92 - 1993.58] [Neutral] [Here,  I'll  get  you  a  closer  look  at  that,  Andy.]
[1993.72 - 1994.26] [Very Negative] [That  is  hilarious.]
[1994.72 - 1996.82] [Neutral] [Even  the  pins  spell  R -O -G.]
[1996.96 - 1998.40] [Very Negative] [No,  those  aren't  the  pins.]
[1998.40 - 1999.34] [Neutral] [Those  are  just  graphics.]
[1999.34 - 2001.38] [Neutral] [But  yes,  it  kind  of  looks  like  it.]
[2001.38 - 2001.92] [Neutral] [So  extra.]
[2001.78 - 2006.86] [Neutral] [So  that  goes  on  there  or  it  comes  off  according  to  your  preference.]
[2007.68 - 2009.56] [Very Positive] [That  is  so  funny.]
[2010.76 - 2011.30] [Neutral] [All  right.]
[2011.62 - 2012.04] [Very Negative] [Oh,  dang  it.]
[2012.04 - 2014.32] [Positive] [Now  I  went  and  screwed  it  up.]
[2014.58 - 2015.70] [Very Positive] [Way  to  go,  Linus.]
[2016.06 - 2017.50] [Negative] [You  dropped  the  ball.]
[2018.00 - 2019.36] [Neutral] [That's  what  I  dropped  today.]
[2020.18 - 2020.60] [Neutral] [Okay.]
[2022.06 - 2023.08] [Very Negative] [I  mean,  they  can't  do  it.]
[2023.08 - 2023.46] [Very Negative] [Oh,  no.]
[2023.48 - 2023.94] [Neutral] [Oh,  yeah.]
[2023.94 - 2024.48] [Neutral] [Oh,  look  at  that.]
[2024.48 - 2027.96] [Neutral] [Yeah,  and  all  the  text  is  right  side  up,  regardless  of  which  way  you  put  it  into.]
[2028.54 - 2029.86] [Very Negative] [Hilarious.]
[2029.52 - 2057.30] [Very Positive] [um  anywho  it's  fully  modular  with  compliance  with  the  atx  3 .1  standard  and  comes  with  a  10  year  warranty  let's  go  ahead  and  get  it  installed  dan  do  you  want  to  hit  me  with  a  merch  message  sure  thing  heck  yeah  hey  linus  any  chance  of  offering  a  certificate  like  corsera  with  ltd  being  well  known  in  the  tech  world  wouldn't  it  be  great  to  offer  something  like  that  for  a  refresher  course,  LDT  University?]
[2058.48 - 2068.14] [Neutral] [It's  something  that  Colton  has  wanted  to  develop  for  a  long  time,  and  not  necessarily  that  specifically,  but  some  kind  of  course.]
[2069.24 - 2081.76] [Very Negative] [Courses  can  be  extremely  lucrative,  and  when  your  job  title  is  Business  Development  Manager,  I  can  understand  why  trying  to  pursue  something  like  that  would  be  very  appealing.]
[2082.22 - 2116.22] [Very Positive] [But  my  issue  every  time  we  bring  it  up  is  that  our  whole  thing  from  day  zero  has  been  taking  advantage  of  YouTube  and  its  incredible  ability  to  democratize  information  and  knowledge,  to  democratize  knowledge  about  PCs  and  software  and  troubleshooting  and  configuration,  and  like  all  these  things,  All  these  things  that  we  do  are  about  the  sharing  of  information.]
[2116.84 - 2123.34] [Neutral] [And  so  how  do  I  reconcile  that  with  a  paid  course  that  is  sort  of  blocked  off?]
[2123.34 - 2125.84] [Neutral] [Like  we  do  exclusive  content,  absolutely.]
[2126.08 - 2131.62] [Very Positive] [Like  over  on  lmg .gg  slash  floatplane,  you'll  find  all  kinds  of  wonderful  exclusives.]
[2131.62 - 2136.30] [Neutral] [Like  you  can  have  interviews  with  various  members  of  our  team.]
[2136.98 - 2139.38] [Positive] [Sammy  has  a  really  cool  series  running  right  now.]
[2139.46 - 2141.54] [Positive] [He  manages  the  floatplane  content  for  us.]
[2141.44 - 2164.18] [Neutral] [he's  got  a  really  cool  series  called  why  is  wan  late  where  he  kind  of  looks  at  the  behind  the  scenes  of  what's  going  on  around  here  on  a  friday  afternoon  but  none  of  that  is  critical  that's  fun  but  you  don't  you  don't  need  it  to  make  a  good  make  a  good  decision  you  know  you  don't  need  it  to  help  your  friends  build  the  best  gaming  computer  for  the  money.]
[2164.18 - 2173.90] [Neutral] [And  so  I've  always  just  felt  like,  yeah,  we  could  do  a  course  on  how  to  build  a  computer  or  whatever.]
[2173.90 - 2177.50] [Neutral] [We  could  do  a  course  on,  you  know,  tech  knowledge.]
[2177.50 - 2187.24] [Neutral] [But  how  do  we  differentiate  that  from  our  standard  content  that  is  our  bread  and  butter  and  is  the  reason  that  you  guys  engage  with  us.]
[2187.24 - 2197.82] [Neutral] [And  how  do  we  make  that  not  just  kind  of  a,  how  do  we,  how  do  we  justify  charging  for  what  we  would  normally  give  you  for  free?]
[2197.82 - 2219.76] [Neutral] [So  we  would  have  to  come  up  with  a  way  to  really  differentiate  that  content,  whether  it's  through,  you  know,  making  it  like  super  professional  and  super  awesome,  or  whether  it's  going  to  another  layer  of  depth,  or  to  your  point,  including  like  a  certificate  with  it  or  something  like  that.]
[2219.76 - 2222.58] [Very Negative] [But  I  just,  I  don't  know,  man.]
[2222.84 - 2232.74] [Negative] [I  just  don't  really,  I  don't  really  think  people  need  a  certificate  to  do  this  kind  of  work.]
[2232.74 - 2242.48] [Neutral] [I  I  think  what  you  really  need  is  some  experience,  and  it  can  be  useful  to  get  a  certificate  just  to  demonstrate  that  you  have  some  experience  and  you  have  some  knowledge.]
[2243.40 - 2248.90] [Neutral] [But  I  don't  think  that's  for  us  to  develop.]
[2248.90 - 2261.22] [Neutral] [I  think  that  if  we  were  going  to  make  a  piece  of  content  that  was  focused  on  arming  people  with  a  whole  whack  ton  of  knowledge,  something  like  how  to  build  a  PC,  the  last  guide  you'll  ever  need.]
[2261.14 - 2265.12] [Positive] [I  think  that's  a  great  example  of  something  that  we  could  have  easily  charged  for.]
[2265.62 - 2274.70] [Neutral] [And  the  kind  of  thing  where  there  would  obviously  be  enough  demand  to  make  a  ton  of  money,  you  know,  for  the  business  development  team.]
[2276.56 - 2281.14] [Very Positive] [Like,  I  think  the  first  one  ended  up  getting  like  10  million  views  or  something  like  that.]
[2281.58 - 2284.96] [Neutral] [And  the  second  one,  I  think,  is  already  closing  in  on  like  two  or  three.]
[2285.24 - 2287.76] [Positive] [Like,  it's  a  really  valuable  resource.]
[2288.66 - 2313.32] [Neutral] [it's  just  with  that  in  mind  then  why  are  we  paywalling  it  right  like  we  don't  really  paywall  anything  that  is  valuable  beyond  just  kind  of  hanging  out  with  us  right  originals  12 .5  12 .5  on  the  og  wow  okay  it's  even  more  than  i  thought  and  that's  a  long  video  that's  a  dense  video  that  That  is  not  an  entertaining  video.]
[2313.46 - 2322.18] [Neutral] [That  is  an  educational  video  that  we  obviously  give  our,  you  know,  some  of  our  entertainment  flair  to,  but  it's  meant  to  be  a  resource.]
[2323.80 - 2325.26] [Positive] [New  one  is  3 .7  now.]
[2325.30 - 2326.42] [Positive] [3 .7  on  the  new  one.]
[2326.44 - 2329.34] [Very Positive] [Okay,  so  yeah,  they're  both  doing  better  than  I  thought  actually.]
[2331.30 - 2331.82] [Very Negative] [I  don't  know.]
[2331.82 - 2332.84] [Very Negative] [I'm  not  saying  never.]
[2332.98 - 2344.96] [Neutral] [It's  possible  Colton  will  talk  me  into  it,  or  we  will  come  up  with  an  angle  that  really  makes  it  feel  sufficiently  different  from  our  regular  content  that  I  think  we  could  justify  it.]
[2345.42 - 2349.68] [Neutral] [But  right  now,  there  is  nothing  in  the  plan.]
[2350.08 - 2356.62] [Neutral] [And  we  have  other  business  opportunities  that  we're  looking  at  more  imminently  than  that.]
[2356.70 - 2357.64] [Neutral] [Yeah,  mining  for  gold.]
[2358.00 - 2365.56] [Neutral] [Yeah,  like  becoming  a  gold  prospector  if  you  were  tuned  into  the  pre -stream,  which  is  archived  exclusively  on  Floatplane.]
[2366.38 - 2372.28] [Neutral] [If  you  guys  want  to  go  back  and  watch  the  pre -show  before  WAN  show  or  the  pre -stream  before  streams  like  this.]
[2373.04 - 2382.46] [Neutral] [That's  a  good  kind  of  value  for  that  membership,  but  that  doesn't  take  away  from  just  the  tech  knowledge  that  we're  disseminating.]
[2385.72 - 2386.94] [Positive] [Dan,  you  got  another  one  for  me?]
[2387.70 - 2388.34] [Neutral] [Yes,  I  do.]
[2388.62 - 2389.18] [Neutral] [Nice.]
[2392.78 - 2395.46] [Neutral] [Hi,  little  D,  little  L,  and  no  big  L.]
[2395.46 - 2428.62] [Very Positive] [Just  built  my  first  PC  with  ARGB.]
[2400.04 - 2407.24] [Very Negative] [Any  suggestions  on  control  software  that  won't  make  me  run  programs  from  three  different  manufacturers  to  work  for  RAM,  GPU,  and  motherboard?]
[2408.00 - 2418.40] [Positive] [I  think  I'm  using  SignalRGB  on  my  system,  my  NCIX  Sign  PC  in  my  office,  and  that  seems  to  be  going  okay  for  me.]
[2418.78 - 2426.22] [Neutral] [I  feel  like  that  landscape  is  kind  of  always  changing,  and  who  has  the  low  overhead  application?]
[2427.60 - 2429.00] [Negative] [It's  kind  of  all  over  the  place.]
[2428.84 - 2432.78] [Very Positive] [for  my  own  system,  I  can  tell  you  right  now,  I  don't  bother.]
[2433.02 - 2437.74] [Very Negative] [Like  for  my  system  at  home  where  I  actually  care  about  performance,  I  just  don't  bother  with  it.]
[2437.80 - 2443.52] [Very Negative] [I  just  let  it  be  rainbow  vomit,  which  doesn't  have  any  CPU  overhead,  and  I  don't  care.]
[2443.88 - 2448.50] [Neutral] [But  if  you  care  about  it  and  you  want  to  configure  it,  then  maybe  give  SignalRGB  a  try.]
[2449.86 - 2452.36] [Very Negative] [I'd  say  that  would  probably  be  your  best  bet.]
[2452.36 - 2455.26] [Neutral] [Full  disclosure,  they  have  been  a  sponsor  of  ours  in  the  past.]
[2455.26 - 2457.92] [Neutral] [I  don't  think  we've  worked  with  them  recently,  but  hey,  there  you  go.]
[2458.50 - 2459.52] [Neutral] [make  of  that  what  you  will.]
[2459.90 - 2460.78] [Positive] [Signal  is  good.]
[2460.78 - 2462.14] [Neutral] [That's  what  I  would  recommend.]
[2462.24 - 2463.12] [Neutral] [You  use  signal  as  well?]
[2463.12 - 2463.80] [Positive] [Okay,  cool.]
[2465.36 - 2466.84] [Neutral] [There  is  no  perfect  one,  though.]
[2467.26 - 2468.50] [Neutral] [Yeah,  that's  fair.]
[2470.78 - 2473.78] [Negative] [Just  plugging  in  a  fan  connector  here.]
[2474.28 - 2475.42] [Neutral] [I'm  going  to  try.]
[2475.42 - 2476.28] [Positive] [This  is  going  to  be  pretty  tough.]
[2476.36 - 2478.80] [Very Positive] [Okay,  Dan,  you  want  to  hit  me  again  while  I  try  and  fight  with  this  thing?]
[2478.80 - 2479.68] [Neutral] [Yeah,  sure.]
[2480.06 - 2482.52] [Positive] [I  really  wish  I  did  this  before  I  put  in  this  NIG.]
[2482.52 - 2490.82] [Very Negative] [I  put  PTM  7950  on  my  CPU  and  I  have  seen  no  cooling  benefit  over  the  core  cell  thermal  paste  I  had  on  there.]
[2491.12 - 2494.82] [Neutral] [Is  my  cooler  the  bottleneck  or  did  I  probably  apply  it  wrong?]
[2496.16 - 2497.86] [Very Negative] [I  doubt  that  you  applied  it  wrong.]
[2497.86 - 2500.34] [Negative] [I  think  it'd  be  pretty  hard  to  screw  up  applying  PTN.]
[2500.46 - 2510.78] [Neutral] [And  also,  I  want  to  make  it  clear  that  while  we  sell  PTN  7950  and  we  think  it's  a  great  product,  it's  not  magic.]
[2511.30 - 2513.04] [Neutral] [You  know,  it's  thermal  paste.]
[2512.86 - 2518.90] [Neutral] [you  should  not  expect  to  get  a  meaningful  performance  boost  from  thermal  paste.]
[2519.68 - 2534.08] [Positive] [You  might  see  a  couple  degrees  lower  temps,  depending  on  the  processor  type,  but  PTM  is  really  best  suited  for  direct  dye  processors,  like  you  might  find  in  a  laptop,  for  instance.]
[2534.78 - 2539.12] [Negative] [So,  oh,  I've  been  using  these  straps  wrong  for  years.]
[2540.20 - 2541.14] [Very Positive] [Interesting.]
[2541.46 - 2542.64] [Neutral] [Oh,  check  this  out.]
[2542.86 - 2544.24] [Neutral] [I  will  come  back  to  your  question.]
[2544.68 - 2553.36] [Neutral] [I,  for  all  this  time,  have  been  going  like  this  and  then  strapping  it  down  like  that,  which  works,  but  that's  not  what  you're  supposed  to  do.]
[2554.48 - 2560.44] [Neutral] [You're  supposed  to  put  them  all  the  way  under,  then  put  this  under,  then  go  like  that.]
[2560.70 - 2562.30] [Very Positive] [Oh,  brilliant.]
[2562.46 - 2564.12] [Very Positive] [I  just  tech -tipped  myself.]
[2566.92 - 2568.06] [Very Positive] [I  am  so  happy.]
[2568.30 - 2571.12] [Very Negative] [I  can't  believe  that  I've  been  doing  this  wrong  all  this  time.]
[2572.48 - 2575.80] [Neutral] [I  mean,  it's  one  of  those  things  where  it's  like,  you  know,  if  it's  working,  then  whatever,  right?]
[2575.90 - 2576.82] [Neutral] [If  it  fits,  I  sit.]
[2577.16 - 2579.42] [Very Positive] [But  no,  this  is  way  better.]
[2579.42 - 2580.78] [Very Positive] [This  is  great.]
[2581.14 - 2584.32] [Very Negative] [Oh,  actually,  no,  I  don't  like  it  as  much  on  this  one.]
[2584.98 - 2591.64] [Neutral] [Because  if  I  do  it  this  way,  then  it's  going  to  sit  right  there  and  I'm  going  to  see  the  stupid  cable.]
[2592.10 - 2593.36] [Neutral] [Ah,  okay.]
[2593.68 - 2595.36] [Neutral] [Well,  hmm.]
[2596.46 - 2598.26] [Neutral] [Okay,  well,  do  it  whatever  way  works  for  you.]
[2598.50 - 2617.44] [Very Positive] [And  this  way  works  for  me  better  for  this  one  so  that  I  can  so  I  can  get  it  over  to  this  side  and  I  can  I  can  trap  it  there  Between  the  hook  and  loop  so  it  doesn't  make  its  way  back  over  Okay  Well,  I'm  less  annoyed  with  myself  for  doing  it  wrong  now  that  I  know  that  this  way  can  also  be  valid  What  question  was  I  answering  again?]
[2617.44 - 2618.72] [Very Negative] [I  no  longer  remember.]
[2618.72 - 2620.18] [Neutral] [Oh,  yeah,  PTM.]
[2620.18 - 2625.72] [Very Positive] [So  really  it's  best  for  bare  dies  So  GPUs  are  a  great  example.]
[2625.72 - 2634.72] [Positive] [We  used  PTM  7950  in  the  last  Scrapyard  Wars  and  that  ended  up  getting  us  really  nice  temps  and  contributed  to  our  system  being  quieter.]
[2635.08 - 2642.50] [Negative] [Because  the  lower  the  temps  on  your  GPU,  the  lower  it  will  spin  the  fans,  especially  in  the  default  profile  before  you  tune  anything.]
[2643.24 - 2644.98] [Neutral] [So  there's  a  definite  benefit  there.]
[2646.12 - 2661.54] [Neutral] [But  if  you  just  throw  it  on  a  CPU  with  an  IHS,  an  integrated  heat  spreader,  and  you  expect  like  a  performance  difference  compared  to  what  is  already  a  pretty  high  performance  thermal  paste,  then  yeah,  I  can  see  how  you'd  be  disappointed,  at  least  out  of  the  gate.]
[2661.42 - 2667.78] [Neutral] [But  the  thing  about  PTM,  or  the  other  thing  about  PTM,  is  that  it's  designed  for  longevity.]
[2668.42 - 2676.92] [Very Positive] [That  stuff  is  super  low -validated  to  last  for  an  extremely  long  time,  many,  many,  many,  many,  many  heating  and  cooling  cycles.]
[2677.28 - 2701.96] [Positive] [And  my  understanding  is  it  actually  tends  to,  instead  of  drying  out  like  some  other  lesser  thermal  compounds,  it  actually  has  a  tendency  to  perform  a  little  bit  better  once  it's  broken  in,  which  used  to  be,  I  feel  like,  more  of  a  thing  back  in  the  day,  back  with  Arctic  silver,  and  then  became  something  that  thermal  paste  manufacturers  would  market  you  didn't  need  for  their  compound.]
[2702.38 - 2704.64] [Neutral] [But  then  I  guess  it  kind  of  became  a  thing  again.]
[2704.64 - 2705.24] [Very Negative] [So  I  don't  know.]
[2706.38 - 2710.36] [Neutral] [There's  a  lot  of  mixed  information  about  that.]
[2710.36 - 2716.28] [Very Negative] [And  frankly,  don't  take  this  the  wrong  way,  but  I  simply  don't  care  enough.]
[2716.14 - 2728.50] [Neutral] [we're  at  the  point  now  where  if  you  buy  a  high  quality  thermal  compound,  the  difference  of  a  degree  or  two  here  or  there  is  not  particularly  meaningful  to  me.]
[2728.90 - 2742.30] [Neutral] [So  for  me,  what  I  like  about  PTM  is  that  I  can  use  it  in  an  application  like  a  laptop  or  wherever,  and  I  can  know  that  it's  not  going  to  dry  out  or  wear  out  in  a  reasonable  amount  of  time.]
[2742.20 - 2752.96] [Negative] [I  have,  as  I've  gotten  older  and  gotten  busier  and  gotten  less  patient,  I  have  found  that  I  care  far  more  about  stuff  just  working.]
[2755.28 - 2760.08] [Neutral] [And  a  little  less  about  getting  one  degree  more  out  of  something,  you  know?]
[2760.96 - 2762.56] [Neutral] [All  right,  I'm  just  plugging  in.]
[2762.56 - 2763.38] [Very Negative] [So  what  is  this?]
[2763.40 - 2764.54] [Neutral] [What  am  I  looking  at  here?]
[2764.54 - 2764.92] [Neutral] [It's  for  the...]
[2764.92 - 2765.98] [Neutral] [Voltage  sense,  I  guess?]
[2765.98 - 2767.14] [Neutral] [It's  the  voltage  sense,  yeah.]
[2767.14 - 2768.26] [Neutral] [Oh,  interesting.]
[2767.90 - 2775.44] [Neutral] [So  it  kind  of,  what,  I  guess  prioritizes  making  sure  that  you  don't  get  any  V -drup  to  the  GPU?]
[2775.44 - 2778.14] [Neutral] [I  can  show  you  what  the  website  says,  I  don't  really  understand.]
[2778.34 - 2789.52] [Neutral] [Alright,  so  yeah,  we  plug  that  little  purple  one  in  directly  to  the  power  supply,  and  then  that  is  spliced  into  these  two  pins  right  here.]
[2790.62 - 2796.20] [Neutral] [Voltage  sensing  mode,  so  you  can  set  it  to  either  CPU  or  GPU  first.]
[2795.90 - 2822.32] [Neutral] [one  by  one  hands  is  voltage  stability  even  during  demanding  games  huh  all  right  maybe  we  haven't  we  haven't  looked  at  this  in  the  lab  or  anything  so  I  don't  actually  know  for  sure  if  it  does  anything  or  if  it  matters  but  I  can  tell  you  it  probably  doesn't  hurt  anything  so  yeah  and  Linus  are  we  giving  these  systems  to  all  of  the  editors  I  do  not  know  what  the  plan  is  for  these  systems  that  That  is  a  good  question  for  Infra.]
[2822.40 - 2822.88] [Neutral] [Hey,  Dan.]
[2823.40 - 2823.76] [Neutral] [Infra  is  the  one  that  asks.]
[2823.76 - 2825.62] [Neutral] [Are  we  building  systems  like  this  for  all  the  editors?]
[2825.82 - 2827.48] [Negative] [No,  this  is  like  the  tester.]
[2827.64 - 2828.68] [Very Positive] [This  is  the  tester  one.]
[2828.68 - 2830.36] [Very Negative] [Oh,  this  is  a  test  system?]
[2830.48 - 2831.02] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[2831.16 - 2831.84] [Neutral] [Right.]
[2831.94 - 2838.54] [Neutral] [Because  I  guess  if  switching  to  AMD  doesn't  actually  even  address  the  stability  issues,  then  there  would  be  no  reason  to  do  it.]
[2839.56 - 2840.18] [Neutral] [Understood.]
[2840.28 - 2841.68] [Very Positive] [That  makes  perfect  sense.]
[2841.84 - 2844.26] [Negative] [I  expect  it  to  be  better  than  what  we  have  now.]
[2844.58 - 2847.84] [Positive] [I  built  a  very  similar  system  for  myself,  and  it's  been  rock  solid.]
[2848.22 - 2852.04] [Neutral] [We've  been  running  AMD  on  the  WAN,  and  this  computer,  knock  on  wood,  but  it's  okay.]
[2852.54 - 2855.82] [Neutral] [Ah,  that's  a,  the  WAN  is  a  very  different  application  than  this  though.]
[2855.82 - 2857.08] [Very Negative] [We  don't  even  use  Premiere.]
[2858.56 - 2859.32] [Neutral] [I  guess  we'll  see.]
[2859.48 - 2859.96] [Neutral] [We'll  see.]
[2860.06 - 2861.04] [Neutral] [We'll  see  guys.]
[2861.28 - 2867.02] [Neutral] [Maybe,  oh,  maybe  what  we  should  do  is  let's  commit  now  to  do  a,  like  a  float  plane  followup.]
[2867.26 - 2869.66] [Negative] [Just  like  we  did  with  the  hard  line  tubing  thing.]
[2870.42 - 2873.18] [Neutral] [So  we  can  do  a  followup  and  we  can  let  you  guys  know  what  we  settled  on.]
[2873.62 - 2882.68] [Neutral] [Or  maybe  what  we'll  do  is  if  we  do  settle  on  these,  we  could  do  another  stream  where  we  build  like  half  a  dozen  machines  and  we  build  a  bunch  of  them  on  camera,  like  we've  done  in  the  past.]
[2882.68 - 2885.54] [Negative] [That  may  be  ill -advisable.]
[2885.90 - 2886.46] [Very Negative] [Oh,  really?]
[2886.78 - 2888.54] [Neutral] [We  shouldn't  build  computers  on  stream  anymore?]
[2888.54 - 2890.60] [Very Negative] [Are  you  saying  that  I  didn't  build  them  good  last  time?]
[2890.74 - 2891.02] [Neutral] [Dan?]
[2891.08 - 2894.34] [Very Negative] [I  thought  the  ones  that  we  were  using  last  time  were  all  built  blindfolded.]
[2895.62 - 2897.20] [Very Negative] [That's  a  rumor  that  I  heard.]
[2897.46 - 2898.02] [Very Negative] [No.]
[2898.34 - 2903.72] [Neutral] [I  think  what  they're  thinking  of  was  the  time  that  I  built  alongside  someone  else.]
[2904.26 - 2907.68] [Neutral] [So  the  ones  other  than  I  did  make  one  error  on  one  of  mine.]
[2907.88 - 2909.64] [Neutral] [But  other  than  that,  the  ones  I  built  were  fine.]
[2909.94 - 2912.98] [Neutral] [But  the  ones  that  we  had  built  by  the  randoms,  I  think,  had  a  lot  of  problems.]
[2913.32 - 2914.48] [Negative] [I  think  that  was  the  problem.]
[2914.60 - 2915.02] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[2915.10 - 2917.10] [Neutral] [So,  but  I  could  build  them  all.]
[2917.46 - 2917.74] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[2917.86 - 2918.34] [Neutral] [OK.]
[2919.66 - 2921.96] [Neutral] [Actually,  I  could  supervise.]
[2921.96 - 2922.76] [Neutral] [We  could  build  them  together.]
[2922.76 - 2923.32] [Neutral] [It'll  be  fun.]
[2923.32 - 2930.04] [Neutral] [Speaking  of  making  mistakes,  I  several  times  have  noted,  oh,  yeah,  I  haven't  plugged  in  my  front  connectors  yet.]
[2930.28 - 2931.78] [Neutral] [And  then  like,  oh,  I  should  do  that  now.]
[2932.04 - 2934.30] [Negative] [And  then  not  done  it.]
[2934.58 - 2937.86] [Neutral] [So  I'm  going  to  do  that  before  we  put  the  GPU  in  real  quick  here.]
[2938.50 - 2940.02] [Positive] [Dan,  do  you  have  a  merch  message  for  me?]
[2940.50 - 2941.70] [Neutral] [Yes,  absolutely.]
[2941.82 - 2945.64] [Neutral] [But  don't  get  more  blood  on  it.]
[2945.98 - 2946.96] [Positive] [Thank  you  for  that.]
[2947.26 - 2955.30] [Neutral] [With  the  possible  advent  of  SteamOS  around  the  corner,  is  it  true  that  AMD  GPUs  are  preferable  for  Linux  these  days,  or  am  I  out  of  date  or  misinformed?]
[2955.80 - 2962.90] [Positive] [My  understanding  is  that  NVIDIA  has  made  some  progress  on  being  more  friendly  for  Linux.]
[2971.40 - 2978.40] [Neutral] [However,  Valve  specifically  supports  AMD  to  a  greater  degree  than  they  do  NVIDIA.]
[2979.28 - 2981.64] [Neutral] [So,  what  is  going  on  here?]
[2981.66 - 2984.42] [Very Negative] [Does  this  only  have  a  power  switch?]
[2985.90 - 2987.14] [Neutral] [Oh,  so  it  does.]
[2987.60 - 2988.48] [Positive] [Okay,  cool.]
[2988.70 - 2991.22] [Very Negative] [Well,  that  makes  plugging  this  in  a  relatively  simple  affair.]
[3021.04 - 3021.04] [Positive] [Okay,  cool.]
[3021.04 - 3021.04] [Neutral] [That's  there.]
[3021.04 - 3021.04] [Negative] [So  because  valve  Only  builds  in  native  support  for  AMD  cards.]
[3021.04 - 3042.16] [Positive] [They  strongly  recommend  if  you  go  look  at  the  requirements  on  their  site  for  the  for  the  SteamOS  image  they  strongly  recommend  that  if  you  want  to  run  it  on  a  desktop  you  configure  that  desktop  to  be  as  similar  to  a  Steam  Deck  as  possible  for  the  best  compatibility  and  stability  experience  and  I  would  recommend  whatever  Valve  recommends  when  it  comes  to  running  their  operating  system  because  yes  it's  under  the  hood  just  Arch  Linux  but  it  also  isn't  Arches,  highly  customizable,  and  can  be  very  temperamental  if  not  configured  expertly,  which  is  exactly  what  we  are  counting  on  Valve  to  do.]
[3042.16 - 3052.68] [Very Positive] [That's  what  makes  it  SteamOS,  is  all  the  work  that  they've  put  into  building  out  features  and  support  and  making  sure  that  it  all  works  together  seamlessly.]
[3053.78 - 3055.52] [Neutral] [All  right,  this  can  go.]
[3056.10 - 3059.24] [Positive] [And  I  think  we're  ready  to  talk  about  our  GPU.]
[3059.56 - 3064.38] [Very Positive] [This  is  the  last  big  ASUS  featured  piece.]
[3064.76 - 3069.14] [Neutral] [It  is  their  RTX  5080  ROG  Astral.]
[3069.88 - 3080.72] [Neutral] [And  5080s  look  like  they  might  be  where  we  end  up  for  our  editing  stations,  regardless  of  whether  we  stick  with  an  AMD  platform  or  go  crawling  back  to  Intel.]
[3082.26 - 3085.64] [Neutral] [There's  a  couple  of  things  that  I  wanted  to  kind  of  run  through.]
[3085.88 - 3088.88] [Very Positive] [First  of  all,  this  is  a  two -generation  upgrade  for  us.]
[3088.82 - 3095.52] [Neutral] [If  you  look  back  at  both  of  our  previous  iterations  there,  that's  the  2021  edition  with  Threadripper  that's  over  on  the  right.]
[3095.92 - 3101.80] [Neutral] [And  then  that's  the  upgrade  that  we  did  behind  the  scenes  to  Intel  13th  gen  over  on  the  left  there.]
[3102.20 - 3105.08] [Neutral] [Both  of  them  are  featuring  3090s.]
[3105.24 - 3112.32] [Positive] [So  we're  going  all  the  way  from  Ampere  to  Blackwell,  skipping  over  Ada  Lovelace,  or  Ada,  I  think  they  ended  up  calling  it.]
[3113.98 - 3123.66] [Very Positive] [So  that's  gonna  give  us  not  only  additional  performance,  but  with  these  50  series,  oh  my  goodness,  this  thing  is  huge.]
[3128.40 - 3130.68] [Neutral] [There  we  go.]
[3131.20 - 3138.36] [Very Positive] [With  the  50  series,  that's  gonna  give  us  their  brand  new  media  engine,  which  I  am  personally  extremely  excited  for.]
[3138.84 - 3140.60] [Neutral] [Do  we  have  any  notes  about  that  in  here?]
[3141.42 - 3145.68] [Neutral] [No,  but  it  can  do  422,  HGBC,  encoding  and  decoding.]
[3145.58 - 3150.72] [Very Positive] [So  much,  much  higher  quality  encoding  is  the  main  thing  that  I  care  about.]
[3151.12 - 3155.12] [Neutral] [And  that's  going  to  come  down  to  software  support,  whether  we  can  utilize  it  at  all.]
[3155.54 - 3168.36] [Neutral] [But  if  we're  building  new  stations  today,  especially  with  the  way  that  performance  for  performance,  40  series  isn't  really  any  cheaper,  then  this  seems  like  the  sweet  spot  for  us.]
[3168.84 - 3177.20] [Neutral] [With  that  said,  that  all  kind  of  relies  on  getting  these  things  for  something  resembling  MSRP,  which  has  not  been  a  thing  yet,  but  that's  okay.]
[3177.34 - 3178.52] [Neutral] [We  can  be  patient.]
[3178.74 - 3185.30] [Neutral] [Anyway,  this  has  an  overclocked  mode  up  to  2790  megahertz  engine  clock,  16  gigs  of  GDDR7  memory.]
[3185.56 - 3191.90] [Negative] [We  don't  really  do  any  AI  stuff  on  our  editing  workstation,  so  we  don't  really  need  the  extra  VRAM  of  their  top  tier  5090.]
[3192.20 - 3197.06] [Positive] [And  Asus  claims  that  their  quad  fan  design  boosts  their  flow  and  pressure  by  up  to  20%.]
[3197.60 - 3212.12] [Very Positive] [They've  also  got  their  patented  vapor  chamber  with  milled  heat  spreader  for  lower  GPU  temperatures,  and  their  phase  change  GPU  thermal  pad,  along  with  powerful  50  amp  MOSFETs  to  help  ensure  enhanced  performance,  stability,  and  higher  overclocking  potential.]
[3212.56 - 3223.06] [Very Negative] [We  won't  be  overclocking  any  of  our  workstations  or  anything  like  that,  but  I  have  heard  through  the  grapevine  that  these  5080s  are  absolutely  monster  overclockers.]
[3223.50 - 3227.92] [Positive] [They  also  have  a  protective  PCB  coating  that  can  guard  against  moisture,  apparently.]
[3228.24 - 3262.66] [Neutral] [So  if  you  work  in  a,  like,  obviously,  don't,  like,  throw  it  in  the  pool  or  whatever,  but  if  you  work  in  an  extremely  humid  environment  that  can  be  a  legitimate  concern  and  it  can  also  help  with  dust  in  extreme  temperatures  apparently  and  whoop  i  just  mushed  my  cable  oh  boy  what  the  crap  look  at  this  bloody  thing  it  makes  even  a  3090  look  kind  of  like  comical  you  know  like  that's  two  3090s  back  there  because  that  we  were  using  that  for  some  kind  of  ai  something  or  other  that  That's  the  one  from  the  color  booth,  I  think.]
[3263.26 - 3264.02] [Neutral] [Look  at  this  thing.]
[3264.02 - 3265.10] [Neutral] [It's  one  card.]
[3266.94 - 3272.78] [Positive] [Anyway,  their  GPU  Tweak  3  software  is  included  for  performance  tweaking,  advanced  thermal  controls,  and  system  monitoring.]
[3273.08 - 3274.36] [Neutral] [Let's  go  ahead  and  get  this  plugged  in.]
[3274.36 - 3276.06] [Positive] [And  hey,  David,  are  we  ready  to  run  this  thing?]
[3276.22 - 3277.38] [Neutral] [I  think  we  are.]
[3277.40 - 3283.62] [Neutral] [All  right,  Dan,  do  you  want  to  hit  me  with  a  couple  of  merge  messages  while  we  get  this  all,  kind  of  get  a  monitor  on  the  desk  and  get  this  all  set  up?]
[3283.74 - 3284.40] [Very Positive] [Absolutely.]
[3284.42 - 3284.90] [Neutral] [All  right.]
[3285.20 - 3286.08] [Positive] [Good  stuff.]
[3286.16 - 3288.96] [Very Positive] [Linus,  you  and  your  team  are  super  awesome  sauce.]
[3289.10 - 3292.22] [Very Positive] [Loved  all  the  LMG  channels  since  the  day  I  found  them.]
[3292.34 - 3292.80] [Positive] [Thank  you.]
[3293.18 - 3296.58] [Neutral] [Excited  for  my  bag,  pen,  and  precision  screwdriver.]
[3297.46 - 3299.78] [Very Positive] [That's  not  a  question,  but  that  was  just  super  nice.]
[3299.82 - 3301.06] [Very Positive] [Oh,  that  is  super  nice.]
[3301.18 - 3304.92] [Positive] [As  a  Micron  employee,  I  love  seeing  the  crucial  storage.]
[3305.12 - 3309.62] [Neutral] [Linus,  how  do  you  go  about  deciding  how  to  hire  engineers  for  labs  and  CW?]
[3309.70 - 3312.40] [Neutral] [How  did  you  know  what  qualifications  you  needed?]
[3313.06 - 3315.00] [Neutral] [That  is  an  excellent  question.]
[3314.84 - 3321.10] [Neutral] [one  that  would  probably  be  best  handled  by  the  people  who  do  hiring  for  us  these  days.]
[3321.52 - 3326.20] [Neutral] [Truthfully  speaking,  I  am  not  really  involved  in  the  hiring  process  anymore.]
[3326.82 - 3335.34] [Neutral] [I  can  tell  you  that  we  don't  necessarily  require  someone  to  have  their  PENG,  so  their  official  engineering  certification.]
[3335.98 - 3350.26] [Positive] [In  fact,  I  don't  think  anyone  on  the  CW  team  has  technically  completed  it,  even  though  the  reason  for  it  is  not  necessarily  because  they're  like  not  good  enough  or  whatever.]
[3350.58 - 3357.24] [Neutral] [Like  one  of  them,  I'm  going  to  mangle  the  details  on  this,  but  it's  something  along  these  lines.]
[3357.24 - 3370.74] [Neutral] [But  one  of  them  basically  was  on  the  brink  of  doing  it,  but  then  their  mentor  or  like  their  proctor  or  whatever,  I  don't  remember  what  the  term  is  for  it,  but  their  mentor  person  died.]
[3370.58 - 3382.56] [Neutral] [and  then  for  them  to  do  it  after  that  would  require  them  to  redo  something  and  they  were  just  like,  well,  I'm  working  already.]
[3383.82 - 3385.70] [Very Positive] [Like,  forget  it.]
[3387.62 - 3394.62] [Negative] [So  just  because  they  don't  necessarily  have  the  credentials  doesn't  mean  that  they  don't  have  the  skills.]
[3396.24 - 3410.68] [Neutral] [I  will  say  that  we  definitely  care  a  lot  about  hiring  for  attitude  and  for  willingness  to  learn  because  knowledge  can  be  taught,  but  a  natural  curiosity  and  a  willingness  to  learn  new  things  can't.]
[3411.12 - 3415.36] [Very Positive] [I  think  a  great  example  of  that  is  actually  walking  around  over  there.]
[3415.60 - 3423.30] [Negative] [David  started  here  as  a  camera  guy  slash  editor,  found  that  he  really  didn't  enjoy  the  editing  part  of  it.]
[3424.66 - 3426.06] [Positive] [Transitioned  to  camera  guy.]
[3426.16 - 3427.20] [Very Negative] [Editing  is  awful.]
[3427.20 - 3427.88] [Very Negative] [It's  the  worst.]
[3427.68 - 3439.10] [Very Positive] [even  though,  even  though,  and  I'm  going  to  call  him  out  a  little  bit  here,  even  though,  frankly,  his  camera  skills  when  he  started  were  a  little  rough  around  the  edges  sometimes,  but,  but  that  was  when  he  started.]
[3439.10 - 3440.84] [Positive] [He  got  way  better  at  it.]
[3440.84 - 3441.98] [Positive] [He  has  a  great  attitude.]
[3441.98 - 3446.48] [Neutral] [And  now  he's  gone  from,  first,  he  started  on  the  writing  team  as  a  junior  writer.]
[3446.48 - 3483.08] [Negative] [Now  he's  a  full,  full  writer  and  has  just  taken  that  that  passion  and  that  willingness  to  learn  and  made  this  place  go  from  like  a  mcjob  doing  something  he  hated  editing  to  i  think  he's  having  a  lot  more  fun  these  days  i  think  so  yeah  so  i  don't  know  so  that's  the  that's  what's  really  important  is  prioritizing  like  attitude  and  willingness  to  learn  because  like  yeah  you  could  i  think  you  could  be  stuck  in  a  dead  end  position  at  a  job  and  you  could  go,  oh,  my  company's  not  doing  enough  to  provide  career  advancement  or  change  opportunities  for  me.]
[3483.08 - 3493.50] [Neutral] [Or  you  can,  you  know,  just  get  in  there  and  contribute  and  learn  and,  you  know,  find  new  things  to  do.]
[3493.50 - 3493.98] [Very Negative] [I  don't  know.]
[3493.98 - 3508.48] [Positive] [I  personally  have  been  having  a  lot  of  fun  working  on  David's  projects,  which  to  me  is  always  a  strong  indicator  that  we're  having  fun  creating  them  overall  because  I  tell  the  team  this  like  all  the  time.]
[3508.48 - 3511.82] [Neutral] [This  is  on  our  like  laws  of  making  good  videos.]
[3511.82 - 3517.64] [Neutral] [Have  fun  because  the  audience's  bullshit  detector  is  like  finely  tuned.]
[3517.64 - 3527.50] [Neutral] [And  if  you're  faking  it,  if  you're  pretending  that  you're  having  fun,  they  pick  up  on  that  immediately  and  they're  not  having  fun  and  then  no  one's  having  fun  and  why  are  we  even  here,  right?]
[3527.50 - 3532.20] [Negative] [And  it's  like,  yeah,  we  could  be  here  just  to  get  raw,  dry  information.]
[3532.50 - 3544.24] [Positive] [Like,  from  our  5080  review,  we  found  that  the  DaVinci  Puget  Bench  results  were  about  25 %  better  than  our  old  systems  with  the  3090.]
[3544.62 - 3552.58] [Positive] [And  we  found  that  our  premier  Puget  Bench  results  were  about  22 %  better  compared  to  our  old  3090.]
[3554.16 - 3556.22] [Positive] [That's  really  useful,  valuable  information.]
[3557.00 - 3561.94] [Negative] [But  if  we  don't  make  it  fun,  then  we're  not  making  it  accessible  to  as  many  people.]
[3561.94 - 3563.22] [Very Positive] [So  that's  really  important  to  us.]
[3564.22 - 3572.90] [Negative] [Oh,  another  thing  I'm  supposed  to  do  while  David  finishes  that  off  is  I'm  supposed  to  change  into  our  featured  shirt  for  today.]
[3574.04 - 3574.68] [Neutral] [Here  we  go.]
[3575.08 - 3580.94] [Neutral] [This  right  here  is  our  sport  button -up  shirt  because  we  are  serious  business  people  now.]
[3580.94 - 3587.86] [Neutral] [We're  no  longer  in  our  early  20s  creating  a  tech  channel  and  whatever.]
[3587.68 - 3591.10] [Positive] [Now  we're  expected  to  kind  of  look  somewhat  decent.]
[3591.46 - 3593.50] [Very Positive] [And  this,  this  is  a  great  way  to  do  it.]
[3593.52 - 3596.40] [Very Positive] [I  think,  oh,  I'm  sorry,  I'm  probably  mangling  the  audio.]
[3596.58 - 3598.60] [Neutral] [I  think  this  is  part  of  our  nine  to  five  lineup.]
[3599.08 - 3601.14] [Very Negative] [I  actually  can't  remember.]
[3600.00 - 3610.32] [Very Positive] [But  basically  it  looks  like  a  professional  button -up  shirt  See  yeah,  yeah  looks  all  professional,  but  it's  like  super  comfy.]
[3610.32 - 3628.90] [Positive] [So  it's  like  really  stretchy  see  that  It's  like  crazy  stretchy  It's  also  nice  and  breathable  and  And  is  like  wicking  and  stuff  so  you  can  be  a  sweaty  boy  and  be  doing  real  work  in  this  thing  and  still  be  reasonably  comfortable  So  yeah,  there  you  go.]
[3629.32 - 3630.28] [Neutral] [LTTstore .com.]
[3632.26 - 3634.48] [Neutral] [David,  do  you  need  any  help  now  that  I  am  done?]
[3634.50 - 3636.34] [Very Negative] [My  son  keyboards  are  the  last  thing.]
[3636.34 - 3636.96] [Neutral] [Oh,  okay.]
[3637.28 - 3639.58] [Neutral] [There  should  be  some  grab  and  goes  in  here  too,  as  well,  right?]
[3639.84 - 3640.68] [Neutral] [Usually.]
[3641.34 - 3642.84] [Neutral] [I  have  one  set,  maybe.]
[3643.30 - 3644.46] [Neutral] [I  don't  know  if  there's  a  dongle  for  it.]
[3644.80 - 3646.26] [Negative] [Nope,  the  dongle  for  this  mice  is  missing.]
[3646.32 - 3646.78] [Very Positive] [Gotta  love  it.]
[3646.78 - 3647.68] [Neutral] [I  have  a  keyboard.]
[3648.40 - 3653.72] [Very Negative] [I  can't  even  really  get  mad  at  people  about  that  because  I'm  as  bad  as  anyone  about  it.]
[3655.72 - 3657.14] [Neutral] [Do  you  have  enough  grab  and  go?]
[3657.32 - 3657.66] [Very Negative] [No.]
[3657.66 - 3658.40] [Very Negative] [For  the  whole  class?]
[3658.40 - 3659.72] [Neutral] [Wait,  oh  really?]
[3659.96 - 3662.10] [Neutral] [Yeah,  there  might  be  some  over  here.]
[3662.34 - 3665.42] [Neutral] [Okay,  well  hey,  here's  a  little  bit  of  inside  baseball  for  you  guys.]
[3666.58 - 3673.84] [Very Negative] [We  are  supposed  to  have  grab  and  go  keyboards,  mice,  power  supplies,  microphones.]
[3674.82 - 3676.90] [Neutral] [Wait,  what  is  he  talking  about?]
[3676.90 - 3677.56] [Neutral] [There's  totally...]
[3680.74 - 3683.28] [Positive] [David,  there's  totally  grab  and  go  keyboards  here.]
[3684.02 - 3684.64] [Neutral] [What's  that?]
[3684.68 - 3686.76] [Positive] [There's  so  many  grab  and  go  keyboards  here.]
[3686.80 - 3687.62] [Neutral] [There's  no  mice  though.]
[3687.82 - 3688.86] [Neutral] [Yeah,  there's  mice.]
[3692.76 - 3693.72] [Negative] [I  don't  like  those  mice.]
[3693.84 - 3695.42] [Very Negative] [Oh,  you  don't  like  these  mice?]
[3695.68 - 3699.54] [Neutral] [I  just,  I  knew  that  there  was  a  couple  that  had  been  moved,  so.]
[3699.68 - 3700.34] [Neutral] [Okay.]
[3702.80 - 3704.42] [Neutral] [All  right,  that  makes  way  more  sense  then.]
[3708.28 - 3709.32] [Very Positive] [So  funny.]
[3710.20 - 3716.02] [Positive] [I  very  regularly  get  called,  oh,  well,  he's  got  two  keyboards  too.]
[3716.12 - 3726.42] [Very Positive] [I  very  regularly  get  called  sort  of  like  out  of  touch  because  I  have  enough  money  that  realistically  I  can  afford  any  keyboard  I  want  and  any  GPU  I  want  and  all  of  that.]
[3727.38 - 3731.56] [Neutral] [But  the  biggest  divas  we  have  here  are  not  me.]
[3731.96 - 3741.72] [Very Positive] [Like  I  regularly  have  to  bring  Plouffe  back  down  to  earth  in  terms  of  what  normal  people  expect  from  a  monitor  and  what  normal  people  are  willing  to  spend  on  a  monitor  and  stuff  like  that.]
[3741.56 - 3772.48] [Very Positive] [and  like  I  am  willing  to  use  not  all  not  any  mouse  but  like  almost  any  mouse  on  set  but  you'll  have  you'll  have  people  like  David  that  are  just  like  oh  I  was  being  silly  these  mice  suck  were  you  yeah  oh  oh  all  right  okay  never  mind  still  I  I  think  you  I  think  you  care  a  fair  bit  about  your  stuff  I  do  I  mean  if  you've  seen  his  garage  you  know  you  know  but  he's  a  gamer  no  yeah  no  yeah  sure  sure  We're  missing  one  ethernet.]

[3776.24 - 3777.74] [Neutral] [No,  there's  a  blue  one  right  there.]
[3778.10 - 3780.28] [Positive] [You  can  just  plug  that  in  anywhere  on  the  switch  and  then  we're  good  to  go.]
[3780.98 - 3782.24] [Very Positive] [Dan,  you  wanna  hit  me  with  a  merch  message?]
[3782.36 - 3791.72] [Negative] [Oh,  in  case  you  guys  are  wondering  what  the  heck  we're  setting  up,  this  is  a  drag  race  between  the  new  machine  and  the  less  new  machine.]
[3792.68 - 3795.02] [Neutral] [Let's  see,  oh,  let's  see  if  she  fires  up.]
[3796.56 - 3800.48] [Neutral] [And,  oh  no.]

[3834.80 - 3836.44] [Positive] [Buying  my  first  ldt  product.]
[3836.70 - 3839.76] [Positive] [I  really  hope  the  quality  matches  the  expectations.]
[3839.76 - 3846.40] [Negative] [Also  question,  in  the  scribe  driver  negative  reviews  I  heard  some  people  complaining  about  the  clicking  sound.]
[3846.40 - 3847.78] [Neutral] [Is  it  still  an  issue?]
[3847.78 - 3849.02] [Neutral] [Still  an  issue?]
[3849.02 - 3850.54] [Neutral] [Clicking  sound  on  the  scribe  driver?]
[3850.54 - 3852.50] [Negative] [I  don't  think  I  have  a  scribe  driver  on  me.]
[3852.50 - 3854.32] [Very Negative] [Does  anybody  have  a  scribe  driver  around?]
[3854.32 - 3855.24] [Very Negative] [I  don't  have  one.]
[3855.24 - 3857.06] [Neutral] [Mine  is  it.]
[3857.06 - 3857.76] [Very Positive] [My  desk.]
[3857.76 - 3858.70] [Neutral] [There's  one  on  your  desk.]
[3858.90 - 3860.28] [Negative] [That's  not  gonna  help  us  much.]
[3860.28 - 3861.30] [Negative] [It's  kind  of  far.]
[3861.30 - 3864.06] [Neutral] [See  you  in  20  minutes.]
[3864.06 - 3865.46] [Neutral] [Do  I  have  a...]
[3866.14 - 3867.06] [Neutral] [Where's  the  little...]
[3867.06 - 3869.14] [Negative] [I  thought  the  scribe  driver  was  supposed  to  click.]
[3869.14 - 3874.74] [Positive] [Yeah,  no,  it  definitely  is  supposed  to,  you  know,  make  a  satisfying  noise.]
[3874.74 - 3877.30] [Neutral] [Let  me  see  if  I  can  just  steal  one  from  someone's  desk.]
[3877.30 - 3878.24] [Neutral] [I'll  be  back.]
[3878.24 - 3879.60] [Neutral] [David  will  host  for  now.]
[3881.88 - 3884.12] [Very Negative] [Does  anyone  have  a  scribe  driver?]
[3884.12 - 3888.02] [Negative] [The  configuration  is  very  challenging,  so  the  memory  training  takes  a  very  long  time.]
[3888.02 - 3890.48] [Negative] [It's  going  to  take  a  while  to  train  anyway.]
[3890.48 - 3890.88] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[3892.40 - 3894.56] [Very Positive] [But  this  capacity  is  very,  very  high.]
[3894.56 - 3897.36] [Neutral] [When  I  was  testing  it  before,  we  got  128  gigs  working.]
[3897.74 - 3899.90] [Negative] [We  did  not  succeed  at  getting  256.]
[3899.90 - 3904.88] [Neutral] [Well,  I've  done  streams  with  Linus  before,  and  he's  freaking  out  because  he  thinks  the  computer's  broken.]
[3904.80 - 3907.68] [Negative] [and  it's  just  taking  a  long  time  to  train  for  the  first  time.]
[3908.02 - 3909.82] [Neutral] [So  just  give  it  extra,  extra  time.]
[3911.04 - 3911.42] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[3911.54 - 3916.74] [Neutral] [Even  when  I  did  it  with,  or  the  person  doing  it  did  it  with  one  stick,  it  took  three,  four  minutes.]
[3917.24 - 3918.10] [Neutral] [That's  a...]
[3918.96 - 3919.92] [Neutral] [I'm  here  to  entertain.]
[3920.10 - 3921.06] [Very Negative] [Where  did  that  go?]
[3921.08 - 3921.58] [Neutral] [Oh,  it's  straight  up  there.]
[3921.58 - 3922.10] [Neutral] [Hi  there.]
[3922.60 - 3924.40] [Neutral] [Business  team  will  almost  certainly  have  one.]
[3924.40 - 3925.80] [Neutral] [I  sure  hope  so.]
[3926.20 - 3928.90] [Neutral] [It  looks  like  I've  got  Windows  on  the  other  one,  so  that's  working.]
[3929.06 - 3929.90] [Very Positive] [Okay,  fantastic.]
[3930.16 - 3931.96] [Neutral] [That  is  our  old  system.]
[3933.42 - 3934.30] [Neutral] [It's  funny.]
[3934.48 - 3941.12] [Neutral] [We  were  originally  gonna  do  the  thumbnail  where  we  put  the  two  computers  side  by  side,  but  they're  gonna  look  so  Similar  it's  the  same  case  same  cooler.]
[3941.12 - 3951.86] [Negative] [So  just  the  GP  would  be  different  and  then  a  thumbnail  That  would  really  be  unimpressive  That's  not  what  we  go  for  we  go  for  blowing  you  away.]
[3951.86 - 3952.48] [Neutral] [You  know  what  I'm  saying?]
[3952.48 - 4001.96] [Negative] [Oh  That  one  wasn't  that  click  so  it's  like  it's  a  bolt -action  pen  So  there's  not  really  a  click  when  you  slide  it  into  place  but  there's  a  bit  of  a  snap  from  the  spring  when  you  rock  it  back  so  that  yep  that's  that's  how  it's  supposed  to  work  uh  oh  who's  destiny  i  take  this  from  well  we'll  figure  that  out  later  in  the  meantime  it's  time  to  troubleshoot  this  pc  should  we  let  it  memory  train  longer  do  you  think  i  think  it  should  memory  train  for  longer  you  want  to  let  it  keep  memory  training  is  that  what  it's  doing  is  that  what  code  15  is  it's  a  memory  thing  yeah  oh  boy  so  that's  the  thing  right  amd  platforms  can  take  a  minute  to  memory  train  and  the  more  you  have  and  the  more  ridiculous  your  configuration,  the  longer  you  can  expect  to  wait.]
[4002.48 - 4004.04] [Neutral] [Asus  code  15.]
[4004.32 - 4009.34] [Neutral] [For  people  that  don't  know,  when  he  says  a  minute,  he  means  that  metaphorically  and  it  could  be  like  20  minutes.]
[4009.80 - 4012.92] [Neutral] [It's  a  concerning  amount  of  time  and  then  it's  fine.]
[4013.76 - 4014.46] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[4015.90 - 4017.08] [Neutral] [Cue  code  15.]
[4017.08 - 4017.62] [Neutral] [Okay,  yes.]
[4017.68 - 4021.20] [Neutral] [It's  definitely  memory  related.]
[4020.98 - 4052.90] [Neutral] [if  the  memory  worked  fine  on  another  board  it  was  probably  okay  alright  well  Dan  want  to  hit  me  with  another  merch  message  sure  yeah  I've  got  a  few  here  let's  see  hey  Linus,  Dan  and  David  as  what  what  did  he  say  I  said  yo  oh  I  thought  Linus  was  freaking  out  about  the  computer  as  someone  who  finds  himself  screaming  at  windows  at  work  regularly  I'm  curious  what  do  you  all  do  when  things  aren't  going  your  way  do  research  take  a  break  cry?]
[4053.74 - 4054.92] [Neutral] [Hey,  that  was  my  answer.]
[4055.46 - 4057.18] [Neutral] [Yeah,  first  get  really  frustrated.]
[4057.52 - 4059.88] [Neutral] [Then,  I  mean,  the  next  thing  is  like  a  Google  search.]
[4060.34 - 4062.92] [Very Negative] [Unless  I,  you  know,  have  already  encountered  it  before.]
[4062.92 - 4067.46] [Neutral] [A  lot  of  the  time  when  I  encounter  a  tech  issue,  I've  seen  something  like  it  at  some  point  in  the  past.]
[4067.96 - 4070.74] [Neutral] [So  I  have  like  at  least  a  starting  point.]
[4070.74 - 4075.28] [Neutral] [But,  I  mean,  for  example,  right  now,  you  know,  my  system  just  like  randomly  closes  Chrome  every  once  in  a  while.]
[4075.28 - 4076.56] [Neutral] [Has  that  happened  in  a  script  review  with  you?]
[4076.68 - 4077.08] [Very Negative] [No.]
[4077.18 - 4079.40] [Neutral] [Oh,  yeah,  it  just  happens  sometimes.]
[4079.18 - 4080.68] [Negative] [Chrome  just  shuts  down.]
[4081.02 - 4082.28] [Very Negative] [It  just  shuts  down.]
[4083.88 - 4087.78] [Neutral] [Also,  occasionally  I'll  come  into  the  office  and  it  doesn't  wake  up  from  sleep  anymore.]
[4087.80 - 4089.50] [Negative] [It  has  some  serious  issues.]
[4089.94 - 4094.08] [Neutral] [And  I  think  they're  related  to  probably  the  IMC  on  my  CPU.]
[4094.70 - 4102.02] [Neutral] [Because  that's  something  I've  learned  over  the  years  is  if  something  is  completely  inexplicable,  then  it's  the  power  supply  or  RAM.]
[4103.08 - 4108.96] [Neutral] [If  nothing  makes  sense  or  it's  intermittent,  it's  power  supply  or  RAM.]
[4109.18 - 4114.48] [Neutral] [That  assumes  you've  already  done  a  fresh  Windows  install  because  it  could  also  definitely  be  Windows.]
[4116.68 - 4117.34] [Neutral] [Research.]
[4117.34 - 4118.76] [Neutral] [Go  find  a  guide.]
[4119.38 - 4126.66] [Very Positive] [I  mean,  we  have  the,  you  know,  whatever  wonder  of  the  world  that  is  YouTube  available  to  us.]
[4126.66 - 4131.42] [Neutral] [And  you  can  do  just  about  anything  there  until  they  pull  the  video  down  about  how  to  de -Google  your  life.]
[4131.48 - 4136.96] [Positive] [I'm  a  big  believer  in  stepping  away  for  10  minutes  and  then  just  hoping  it  fixes  itself  and  coming  back.]
[4137.08 - 4138.32] [Neutral] [And  sometimes  it  does.]
[4138.46 - 4139.34] [Neutral] [Oh,  it  do.]
[4139.34 - 4143.62] [Neutral] [And  if  it  doesn't,  then  it  can  also  fix  your  mind.]
[4144.08 - 4155.88] [Positive] [The  number  of  times  that  I've  been  stumped  on  a  Wordscapes  puzzle  for  10  minutes,  and  then  just  put  it  away  and  come  back  to  it  the  next  day  and  solved  it  instantly,  it's  wild  what  a  fresh  perspective  will  do  for  you.]
[4156.02 - 4161.36] [Very Negative] [Oh  yeah,  when  you're  facing  a  boss  in  a  video  game  and  you  can't  meet  it,  you're  like,  this  is  impossible,  and  then  you  go  away  and  first  try  it  when  you  come  back.]
[4161.42 - 4161.86] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[4161.56 - 4219.00] [Positive] [my  uh  my  son  is  seven  and  getting  really  curious  about  circuits  and  computers  and  how  they  work  cool  any  ideas  for  how  to  get  him  engaged  or  excited  my  best  idea  now  is  rebuilding  an  old  uh  beater  off  of  craigslist  i  mean  it  depends  how  interested  they  are  in  like  like  actual  circuits  and  stuff  versus  just  building  computers  uh  but  there  was  this  uh  this  kit  that  we  picked  up  a  while  back  that  was  pretty  cool.]
[4219.00 - 4219.00] [Negative] [It's  less  electronics  and  more  electricity.]
[4219.00 - 4219.00] [Neutral] [Let  me  see  if  I  can  find  the  one.]
[4201.14 - 4202.74] [Neutral] [Snap  circuits  is  that  the  one?]
[4203.62 - 4208.80] [Very Positive] [Oh  yes  here's  your  captcha  just  to  go  to  amazon .ca  really?]
[4209.46 - 4220.72] [Positive] [Yeah  snap  circuits  it's  pretty  cool  so  it  comes  with  a  book  and  it  comes  with  like  a  bunch  of  different  stuff  like  there's  a  fan  and  there's  a  light  and  there's  little  resistor  boards  and  stuff  like  that.]
[4221.00 - 4239.98] [Neutral] [and  it  basically  has  like  a  project  book  that  it  comes  with  and  you  use  these  snapping  pieces  to  build  a  whole  bunch  of  different  projects  so  they'll  learn  about  DC  electricity  and  switches  and  the  different  functions  of  all  the  different  little  modules.]
[4239.98 - 4241.42] [Positive] [Pretty  cool.]
[4241.42 - 4272.30] [Positive] [My  son  played  around  with  it  a  fair  bit  actually  when  he  was  younger  and  then  got  bored  of  it  because  as  kids  are  apt  to  do  but  yeah  it  definitely  seems  pretty  cool  are  we  going  to  call  that  it  for  memory  training  i  think  so  i  think  we  should  go  to  two  sticks  yeah  so  we  ran  into  this  when  we  were  preparing  for  this  build  we  did  not  actually  manage  to  get  all  four  sticks  running  so  your  mileage  may  vary  on  that  but  apparently  asus  and  kingston  are  working  on  getting  256  gigs  of  ram  working  on  these  CU  dims  in  bypass  mode.]
[4272.30 - 4280.48] [Positive] [As  it  is,  even  getting  just  128  gigs  working  at  the  speed  that  we  were  able  to  get  it  working  at  is  pretty  cool.]
[4280.48 - 4283.98] [Very Positive] [So  I  think  we  got  5 ,600  work,  5 ,200?]
[4284.24 - 4287.30] [Very Positive] [We  actually,  with  the  128,  we're  getting  above  6 ,000.]
[4287.30 - 4289.96] [Neutral] [They  claim  256  at  5 ,600.]
[4290.10 - 4290.94] [Neutral] [Okay,  got  it.]
[4290.94 - 4293.60] [Very Negative] [So  let's  go  ahead  and  shut  this  bad  boy  down.]
[4297.04 - 4344.50] [Neutral] [your  mileage  may  vary  though  i  mean  compared  compared  to  the  old  system  uh  of  120  gigs  which  was  set  at  4  000  megatransfers  per  second  uh  even  5600  would  be  a  huge  upgrade  although  in  editing  the  capacity  is  more  important  than  the  speed  certainly  for  after  effects  yeah  it's  like  a  hundred  percent  just  everything's  done  to  ram  yep  oh  boy  can  i  even  get  it  i  didn't  like  that  sound  uh  okay  well  she's  in  there  um  i'm  gonna  need  to  get  her  out  of  there  oh  there  we  go  that'll  work  yeah  there's  one  of  the  sticks  other  more  different  stick  all  right  yeah  high  capacity  memory  compatibility  on  amd  is  do  we  need  a  sag  bracket  for  that  card  uh  does  it  come  with  one?]
[4344.50 - 4346.18] [Very Negative] [No,  I  don't  think  so.]
[4346.28 - 4346.84] [Very Positive] [Woo!]

[4349.98 - 4350.82] [Positive] [She's  saggy.]
[4350.82 - 4351.92] [Very Positive] [DIY  something  beautiful.]
[4352.00 - 4352.82] [Positive] [She's  saggy.]
[4352.82 - 4354.48] [Neutral] [Nah,  she's  okay.]
[4354.48 - 4355.66] [Negative] [It's  not  going  to  break  it.]
[4356.86 - 4357.66] [Neutral] [Is  that  a  second  one?]
[4358.10 - 4359.20] [Neutral] [No,  no,  no,  no.]
[4359.52 - 4360.34] [Neutral] [Yeah,  that's  right.]
[4360.34 - 4360.90] [Neutral] [You  need  two.]
[4360.90 - 4361.80] [Neutral] [She's  alright.]
[4362.18 - 4363.30] [Very Positive] [I  like  the  way  David  thinks.]
[4363.80 - 4368.82] [Neutral] [That  is  not  a  reason  to  buy  multiple  precision  screwdriver  sets.]
[4368.84 - 4370.64] [Neutral] [I  think  we  should  put  that  on  the  sales  page.]
[4371.06 - 4374.24] [Very Positive] [Works  as  an  excellent  sag  bracket  for  your  stupidly  large  GPU.]
[4374.24 - 4375.52] [Neutral] [Buy  a  three  pack.]
[4375.52 - 4381.80] [Negative] [Okay  we're  still  stuck  on  15  but  this  time  it  could  just  be  training.]
[4382.22 - 4386.62] [Neutral] [I  wonder  if  that  other  time  it  was  I  wonder  if  it  was  training.]
[4386.62 - 4387.14] [Positive] [I  told  you.]
[4387.14 - 4390.20] [Very Negative] [Did  we  try  leaving  it  for  like  half  an  hour?]
[4390.20 - 4392.46] [Very Negative] [No  we  didn't  have  time  we  were  in  such  a  rush  this  morning.]
[4392.46 - 4403.22] [Very Positive] [Oh  because  Jake  has  told  me  that  he  has  seen  it  in  the  past  with  these  AMD  systems  where  he  will  literally  give  up  and  walk  away  and  come  back  and  memory  training  is  complete.]
[4403.22 - 4405.86] [Negative] [I  told  you  it's  a  concerning  length  of  time.]
[4407.00 - 4408.90] [Neutral] [So  your  mileage  may  vary.]
[4408.90 - 4415.28] [Positive] [Hopefully  this  will  train  and  be  good  in  a  reasonable  amount  of  time  but  in  the  meantime  Dan  will  kill  some  time  with  another  merch  message.]
[4415.28 - 4415.66] [Neutral] [Sure.]
[4415.76 - 4415.94] [Neutral] [Sure.]
[4415.94 - 4416.04] [Neutral] [Sure.]
[4416.04 - 4416.90] [Neutral] [Sure.]
[4416.90 - 4417.34] [Neutral] [Hi.]
[4417.34 - 4423.08] [Neutral] [I'm  planning  on  building  a  new  PC  and  I  was  looking  to  use  it  for  gaming  slash  productivity  slash  streaming.]
[4423.08 - 4430.36] [Neutral] [I  was  looking  at  getting  the  Ryzen  9  9950X  or  should  I  wait  for  the  X3D  or  go  with  the  9950X?]
[4431.24 - 4442.46] [Neutral] [If  gaming  is  your  primary  consideration,  then  it's  hard  not  to  justify  the  extra  upcharge  for  the  X3D  versus  the  non -X3D  variant.]
[4443.22 - 4452.44] [Neutral] [But  if  realistically  it's  like  a  family  computer  slash  sort  of  workstation,  you  do  a  bunch  of  other  stuff  on  it,  it's...]
[4454.00 - 4484.78] [Neutral] [I  don't  know  that  I  would  bother  waiting  like  if  you  want  a  new  computer  then  get  a  new  computer  there's  always  always  something  around  the  corner  and  what  we  have  found  is  that  particularly  if  you're  gaming  at  higher  resolutions  like  even  1440p  if  you  have  a  modern  CPU  it's  not  going  to  be  your  bottleneck  anyway  so  it  kind  of  is  what  it  is  and  the  thing  is  you're  buying  into  AM5  which  AMD  has  still  committed  to  supporting  until  I  think  2027.]
[4484.78 - 4489.68] [Neutral] [So  you  will  have  future  upgrade  options  available  to  you.]
[4490.04 - 4496.92] [Neutral] [So  you  can  always  maybe  throw  an  X3D  in  later  once  they  come  down  in  price  and  you  just  kind  of  flip  your  99 .50  or  whatever  the  case  may  be.]
[4498.06 - 4504.82] [Negative] [This  is  still  not  It  took  four  plus  minutes  for  one  stick.]
[4504.82 - 4510.62] [Neutral] [So  it  takes  Why  don't  you  tell  us  about  the  old  system  that  we're  going  to  be  upgrading  from?]
[4510.62 - 4511.66] [Neutral] [Sure.]
[4511.68 - 4513.14] [Neutral] [I  could  do  that.]
[4513.14 - 4518.04] [Neutral] [So  this  is  the  old  Intel  based  one.]
[4518.04 - 4519.80] [Neutral] [So  we've  got  a  13900K.]
[4519.80 - 4526.90] [Neutral] [This  also  has  128  gigs  of  memory,  but  running  at  much  lower  speeds  because  we're  populating  all  four  memory  slots.]
[4527.30 - 4539.36] [Negative] [This  particular  system  has  dual  3090s  because  I  believe  it  was  used  for  some  AI  inferencing  stuff  in  addition  to  being  used  as  an  editing  station  in  one  of  the  isolated  booths.]
[4539.36 - 4543.32] [Neutral] [Same  SSD,  same  one  terabyte  Crucial  P5.]
[4543.32 - 4554.88] [Very Positive] [We're  using  these  pro  art  motherboards  not  because  they  make  any  sense  whatsoever  at  the  price  but  because  I  think  ASUS  gave  us  like  a  sweetheart  of  a  deal  on  them  and  I  wouldn't  say  no  to  that.]
[4554.88 - 4556.86] [Neutral] [There's  certainly  nothing  wrong  with  them.]
[4556.86 - 4559.58] [Positive] [We're  using  Seasonic  Prime  power  supplies.]
[4559.58 - 4561.82] [Neutral] [Good  power  supply  but  so  is  the  ASUS.]
[4561.82 - 4567.28] [Neutral] [As  long  as  you're  using  a  good  power  supply  I  don't  think  that's  going  to  have  any  kind  of  impact  on  performance  or  stability.]
[4567.32 - 4569.28] [Neutral] [Seasonic  doesn't  have  a  magnetic  OLED,  though.]
[4569.34 - 4570.26] [Neutral] [Yeah,  that's  true.]
[4570.32 - 4571.66] [Neutral] [Seasonic  does  not  have  that.]
[4571.70 - 4572.70] [Positive] [Way  to  go,  Seasonic.]
[4573.36 - 4574.60] [Neutral] [Get  with  the  times.]
[4577.10 - 4578.26] [Positive] [All  right,  Dan,  hit  me.]
[4578.58 - 4579.68] [Neutral] [Sure,  sure,  sure,  sure.]
[4582.32 - 4586.22] [Very Negative] [Hey,  Linus,  do  you  think  the  computer  industry  will  outlast  the  games  industry?]
[4586.40 - 4590.18] [Positive] [I  got  a  game  design  degree,  and  we'll  see  how  that's  going.]
[4590.40 - 4594.78] [Neutral] [So  I'm  going  to  law  school,  waiting  on  some  LSAT  results.]
[4596.18 - 4600.42] [Neutral] [Everything  is  cyclical  in  both  tech  and  gaming.]
[4600.42 - 4607.32] [Positive] [And  those  two  cycles  in  those  two  industries  do  contribute  to  each  other.]
[4607.32 - 4611.70] [Negative] [They've  both  seen  a  major  pullback.]
[4611.70 - 4624.52] [Neutral] [The  tech  industry  one,  I  kind  of  understand  because  things  were  reaching  a  point  of  somewhat  ridiculousness  for  how  hard  the  big  tech  giants  were  bidding  for  any  of  the  tech  companies.]
[4624.54 - 4636.86] [Very Negative] [employee,  like  literally  anyone  fresh  out  of  school  was  just  getting  bombarded  with  job  offers  for  a  little  while  there,  to  the  point  where  it  just  kind  of  didn't  seem  to  be  sustainable  forever.]
[4636.86 - 4640.34] [Neutral] [So  I  understand  where  the  pullback  is  coming  from  there.]
[4640.34 - 4665.74] [Neutral] [I  wish  they  weren't  pulling  back  so  hard  because  the  impact  on  people  who  have  spent,  you  know,  years  of  their  lives,  educating  themselves  to  work  in  the  tech  industry,  or  in  some  cases,  spent  years  of  their  lives  working  at  these  companies  are  just  being  summarily  let  go  or  being  put  in  a  position  where  they  feel  like  they're  being  pushed  to  quit.]
[4665.74 - 4668.66] [Very Negative] [And  that  sucks.]
[4668.66 - 4671.36] [Neutral] [The  games  industry  is  one  that  I  don't  really  get  as  much.]
[4671.36 - 4680.24] [Negative] [Like,  yeah,  there  was  a  big  COVID  boom  and  some  studios  overhired  and  ambitious  projects  were  begun  that  maybe  weren't  going  to  pan  out.]
[4680.24 - 4681.78] [Neutral] [And  so  I  can  see  a  little  bit  of  that  happening.]
[4682.14 - 4712.26] [Neutral] [but  when  you  have  some  of  these  companies  that  and  then  David  falls  the  games  industry  a  little  bit  closer  than  I  do  but  when  you  have  some  of  these  companies  you  know  announcing  a  big  layoff  and  then  literally  talking  record  profits  like  a  week  later  it  doesn't  really  track  for  me  I  don't  really  I  don't  really  understand  it  I  think  there's  multiple  layers  to  the  issue  of  how  it  happens  I  think  that  you  know  the  chase  for  profits  is  one  of  it  I  think  part  of  it  is  we've  seen  the  collapse  of  new  live  service  games  like  new  live  service  games  rarely  succeed.]
[4712.70 - 4715.16] [Neutral] [And  that  for  a  little  bit,  that  was  what  the  big  investments  were.]
[4715.50 - 4717.78] [Neutral] [Like  Concord's  the  big  one,  200  plus  million  dollars.]
[4717.86 - 4718.32] [Neutral] [Right.]
[4718.70 - 4719.94] [Very Negative] [Just  down  the  drain.]
[4720.34 - 4720.88] [Neutral] [Gone.]
[4721.00 - 4721.30] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[4721.44 - 4722.40] [Neutral] [How  long  was  it  live?]
[4722.40 - 4723.50] [Neutral] [Like  a  week,  two  weeks?]
[4723.50 - 4724.14] [Neutral] [Something  like  that.]
[4724.14 - 4724.98] [Neutral] [Something  like  that.]
[4725.34 - 4728.76] [Neutral] [Yeah,  and  then  they  just  refunded  everyone  and  walked  away  from  it.]
[4728.80 - 4730.42] [Neutral] [They  might  bring  it  back,  but  who  knows?]
[4730.86 - 4734.84] [Neutral] [But  then  you  got  to  look  at  it  and  you  got  to  go  like,  okay,  so  fine.]
[4735.26 - 4739.54] [Negative] [The  investments  that  we've  made  in  live  service  games  were  just  not  going  to  be  able  to  topple  Fortnite.]
[4739.26 - 4757.64] [Very Negative] [we're  not  going  to  be  able  to  we're  not  going  to  be  able  to  draw  that  audience  away  from  it  but  then  you  know  from  software  Larian  have  shown  that  there's  a  massive  appetite  for  not  live  service  games  so  do  we  have  to  lay  all  these  people  off?]
[4758.58 - 4781.48] [Neutral] [oh  hey  that's  a  different  code  dude  I  wonder  if  we  just  didn't  wait  long  enough  I  told  you  I  don't  know  if  I  want  to  try  on  stream  but  I  do  want  to  say  that  it  is  very  possible,  given  how  long  this  was  hanging  on  15,  that  this  was  just  memory  training  before  and  it  was  256  gigs  of  flipping  memory  and  needed  a  hot  minute  to  finish  training.]
[4781.62 - 4782.82] [Neutral] [Okay,  well  that's  pretty  cool.]
[4782.82 - 4787.82] [Very Positive] [Anyway,  the  point  is  I  feel  like  people  could  have  been  reassigned.]
[4787.86 - 4789.54] [Positive] [I  got  something.]
[4789.68 - 4790.46] [Neutral] [You  got  something?]
[4790.46 - 4791.20] [Neutral] [On  mine.]
[4791.40 - 4792.24] [Positive] [He's  got  something.]
[4792.66 - 4794.14] [Negative] [It  was  on  96  for  a  bit.]
[4794.22 - 4795.98] [Negative] [I've  got  bias.]
[4825.58 - 4825.58] [Neutral] [If  we  do  a  whip.]
[4825.58 - 4825.58] [Neutral] [Is  this  display  on?]
[4825.58 - 4825.58] [Negative] [It's  not  getting  signal.]
[4800.00 - 4800.88] [Negative] [This  is  not  plugged  in.]
[4801.04 - 4802.48] [Neutral] [Oh,  it  must  have  come  unplugged.]
[4802.50 - 4803.16] [Neutral] [So  there's  your  problem.]
[4803.26 - 4804.08] [Neutral] [Maybe  I  unplugged  it.]
[4804.16 - 4805.14] [Very Negative] [Oh,  wait,  it  is  plugged  in.]
[4805.14 - 4805.72] [Very Negative] [I  lied.]
[4806.90 - 4808.78] [Neutral] [Yeah,  this  one.]
[4809.34 - 4809.76] [Neutral] [Okay.]
[4809.82 - 4811.08] [Neutral] [It  was  working  before.]
[4811.08 - 4811.84] [Negative] [Oh,  it's  not.]
[4811.90 - 4813.78] [Neutral] [The  monitor  seems  to  be  the  one  that's  having  the  issue.]
[4813.94 - 4814.78] [Very Negative] [Oh,  no.]
[4815.24 - 4815.38] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[4815.44 - 4816.34] [Neutral] [Well,  let's  give  it  a  sec.]
[4816.38 - 4817.74] [Neutral] [I've  got  it  on  my  side.]
[4818.26 - 4818.80] [Negative] [Sick.]
[4820.50 - 4821.40] [Neutral] [We're  close,  guys.]
[4821.40 - 4822.02] [Neutral] [We're  close.]
[4822.48 - 4824.52] [Neutral] [Dan,  are  you  troubleshooting  something,  or  do  you  want  to  hit  me  with  a...]
[4824.56 - 4825.94] [Negative] [No,  I'm  just  waiting  for  this  monitor.]
[4825.96 - 4826.36] [Positive] [Hey!]
[4827.22 - 4828.34] [Neutral] [Let's  go.]
[4828.82 - 4829.44] [Neutral] [All  right.]
[4829.32 - 4831.16] [Neutral] [You'll  want  to  go  into  BIOS  and  make  sure.]
[4831.36 - 4832.34] [Neutral] [I  sure  will.]
[4832.40 - 4834.86] [Neutral] [Oh,  we  got  to  go  test  that  AI  assistant  too.]
[4835.38 - 4836.32] [Neutral] [Oh,  that's  right.]
[4836.46 - 4836.90] [Neutral] [Okay.]
[4837.60 - 4838.44] [Neutral] [How  does  that  work?]
[4838.86 - 4840.10] [Neutral] [Do  you  know  anything  about  it?]
[4840.10 - 4840.64] [Very Negative] [Nope.]
[4841.16 - 4841.74] [Neutral] [All  right.]
[4842.04 - 4843.10] [Neutral] [Tools  maybe?]
[4845.38 - 4846.66] [Positive] [Let  me  look  it  up.]
[4846.66 - 4847.62] [Negative] [Well,  it's  not  in  there.]
[4848.26 - 4849.24] [Neutral] [Q  dashboard?]
[4849.68 - 4850.54] [Very Negative] [Nope.]
[4850.90 - 4852.40] [Very Negative] [Oh,  is  that  a  lockdown?]
[4853.22 - 4854.00] [Very Positive] [Oh,  wow.]
[4854.74 - 4855.48] [Negative] [Not  quite.]
[4855.90 - 4857.34] [Neutral] [It  does  give  you  the  device  ID  though.]
[4857.26 - 4860.36] [Neutral] [Well,  that  can  be  really  useful  if  you're  doing  like  pass  through  or  whatever.]
[4860.38 - 4863.90] [Neutral] [I  think  you  can  look  it  up  in  Linux  anyway,  but  I  don't  know  what's  there.]
[4864.28 - 4865.82] [Neutral] [Ah,  okay.]
[4866.24 - 4867.26] [Neutral] [Full  HD  setup.]
[4867.44 - 4869.78] [Neutral] [Whoa,  you  can  have  full  HD  in  the  setup  screen?]
[4869.88 - 4870.88] [Neutral] [Well,  I  guess  I  don't  care.]
[4872.08 - 4881.50] [Neutral] [At  any  rate,  we  already  appear  to  have  our  memory  profile  enabled  because  it's  already  running  at  5600.]
[4881.86 - 4882.76] [Very Negative] [No,  we  don't.]
[4884.16 - 4884.74] [Very Positive] [Interesting.]
[4885.12 - 4887.02] [Neutral] [AEMP.]
[4886.26 - 4888.14] [Neutral] [MP,  huh.]
[4888.54 - 4891.90] [Negative] [We  are  not  gonna  try  to  go  all  the  way  to  6 ,800.]
[4892.02 - 4892.50] [Neutral] [Try  it.]
[4892.72 - 4894.92] [Neutral] [No,  that's  not  gonna  happen.]
[4896.02 - 4899.56] [Neutral] [We're  gonna  go  to,  what  was  it,  5 ,600  you  guys  got  working  or  6 ,000?]
[4899.98 - 4901.70] [Negative] [He  got  64  working.]
[4901.72 - 4902.18] [Neutral] [64?]
[4902.48 - 4904.64] [Neutral] [Yeah,  he  was  above  6 ,000.]
[4905.76 - 4906.78] [Neutral] [Okay,  sure.]
[4907.50 - 4908.54] [Neutral] [Yeah,  we  could  do  64.]
[4908.54 - 4910.50] [Neutral] [I  think  he  said  he  got  68,  but  I'm  not  100 %  sure  on  that.]
[4910.56 - 4911.28] [Neutral] [Okay,  you  know  what?]
[4911.38 - 4912.32] [Neutral] [Fine,  we're  gonna  try  it.]
[4913.08 - 4916.24] [Neutral] [I  will  be  very  surprised,  and  also  we  might  be...]
[4917.10 - 4944.22] [Neutral] [it's  not  always  better  to  just  go  for  pure  frequency  especially  on  AMD  these  days  but  what  the  heck  let's  uh  let's  give  it  a  shot  let's  let's  see  if  it  happens  it  won't  have  to  fully  retrain  it  should  just  reset  and  oh  boy  it's  stuck  on  15  again  cool  Dan  quick  stall  for  time  go  go  go  it's  gonna  have  to  retrain  I'm  considering  upgrading  my  RAM  from  5600  mega  transfers  C  36  to  6000  megatransfer's  C30.]
[4944.22 - 4950.72] [Neutral] [Just  can't  decide  if  the  performance  is  worth  it  or  if  I  should  just  keep  waiting  until  the  latencies  get  even  tighter.]
[4950.72 - 4971.96] [Neutral] [I  don't  know  how  much  tighter  we're  going  to  see  DDR5  latencies  and  you're  going  to  be  limited  not  just  by  the  memory  that's  available  but  also  by  the  integrated  memory  controller  on  your  CPU  which  understandably  tends  to  be  kind  of  targeting  the  memory  that  is  available  during  the  development  of  said  CPU.]
[4973.86 - 4979.20] [Neutral] [As  for  whether  you're  gonna  notice  a  meaningful  performance  difference,  you  might  see  a  little  bit  from  that.]
[4980.24 - 4995.30] [Neutral] [Not  enough  to  justify  the  full  price  of  that  new  memory  kit,  but  if  you  sell  your  old  memory  kit,  get  a  decent  price  for  it,  and  you're  only  paying  like  another,  you  know,  30  bucks,  40  bucks  or  something  like  that,  on  top  of  what  you  were  able  to  sell  for,  and  I'd  say  that  could  be  a  worthwhile  upgrade,  yeah.]
[4995.64 - 4998.06] [Neutral] [So  the  AI  thing  is  a  desktop  thing.]
[4998.24 - 4998.68] [Neutral] [Oh,  it's  a  desktop  thing.]
[4998.70 - 5002.54] [Neutral] [I  thought  it  was  in  the  BIOS  based  on  the  marketing,  but  it  is  a  desktop  thing.]
[5002.56 - 5004.30] [Neutral] [All  right,  we'll  get  to  that  when  we  get  to  it  then.]
[5005.02 - 5005.98] [Neutral] [We'll  have  to  install  it.]
[5006.06 - 5007.38] [Positive] [All  right,  Dan,  hit  me.]
[5008.22 - 5012.04] [Neutral] [Linus,  what  DIY  projects  are  you  working  on  apart  from  Lambo  Bike?]
[5012.28 - 5015.02] [Neutral] [Thoughts  on  more  DIY  or  maker  content?]
[5015.12 - 5023.20] [Positive] [I  love  the  VPN  video  and  would  love  more  videos  on  PyNAS  or  HexOS  Build  setup  start  to  finish.]
[5023.74 - 5028.78] [Very Negative] [given  I  cannot  finish  that  project  do  I  need  another  project  right  now?]
[5029.78 - 5045.80] [Positive] [I  will  say  that  I  am  learning  about  casting  I've  always  been  kind  of  interested  in  it  I  did  a  metal  art  and  jewelry  class  back  in  high  school  and  I  had  a  ton  of  fun  I  made  like  a  cool  chain  out  of  just  like  silver  wire  and  I,  what  else  did  I  make?]
[5045.84 - 5055.42] [Positive] [I  made  a  small  cast  pendant  and  I  just,  I  thought  it  was  such  a  blast  so  I'm  reading  this  book  called  Practical  Guide  to  Casting.]
[5055.42 - 5061.04] [Positive] [I'm  about  halfway  through  and  I  just  finished  the  part  where  it  talks  about  sling  casting.]
[5061.04 - 5069.82] [Neutral] [So  to  fling  the  metal  into  the  investment  that  the  mold  is  in,  there's  multiple  ways  to  do  it.]
[5069.82 - 5078.60] [Neutral] [So  you  can  use  like  a  centrifugal  thing  where  you  like  wind  up  a  spring  and  then  you  let  go  and  it  like  spins  and  it  like  like  flings  the  molten  metal  into  the  mold.]
[5079.22 - 5083.46] [Neutral] [You  can  do  ones  that  are  just  like  gravity  driven.]
[5083.74 - 5091.38] [Neutral] [So  what  you  do  is  you  just  have  like  the,  or  sorry,  not  gravity  driven,  vacuum,  vacuum  driven.]
[5091.66 - 5097.48] [Very Negative] [So  you  have  like  a  vacuum  that  you  pull  around  the  mold  and  it  like  sucks  the  metal  into  it.]
[5098.04 - 5114.74] [Neutral] [And  I  just  got  to  the  one  about  sling  casting  where  basically  what  you  do  is  you  take  your  mold  and  then  the  gate  at  the  top,  you  make  it  narrow  enough  that  the  surface  tension  of  the  molten  metal  will  keep  it  from  going  down.]
[5115.08 - 5116.26] [Very Positive] [So  you  can  melt  it  all.]
[5116.32 - 5124.60] [Positive] [You  melt  it  all  and  then  you  put  it  in  a  sling  and  you  basically  like  whip  it  around  like  this  to  drive  the  metal  down  through  the  gate  into  the  mold.]
[5124.60 - 5127.26] [Neutral] [And  I'm  like,  what?]
[5127.92 - 5128.90] [Very Positive] [Because  that's  pretty  cool.]
[5129.86 - 5133.70] [Very Positive] [So  yeah,  I  want  to  learn  about  casting.]
[5133.46 - 5138.50] [Positive] [ZOS015  says,  please  finish  the  SV650S.]
[5138.52 - 5140.50] [Positive] [It's  my  old  bike  and  I'd  love  to  see  it  decked  out.]

[5142.02 - 5143.66] [Neutral] [And  we  want  the  beard  back.]
[5144.22 - 5145.62] [Negative] [I  want  the  beard  back  too.]
[5146.02 - 5149.96] [Positive] [And  I  will  do  it  as  soon  as  I  finish  painting  that  stupid,  stupid  bike.]
[5150.10 - 5152.26] [Positive] [I  gave  a  progress  update  on  Wancho  a  little  while  ago.]
[5152.74 - 5163.08] [Neutral] [I  haven't  touched  it  since  then,  but  most  of  the  parts  are  white  now,  which  is  the  layer  before  pink,  which  is  the  layer  before  effect  layer,  which  is  the  layer  before  clear  coat.]
[5165.82 - 5166.64] [Neutral] [So,  yeah.]
[5167.44 - 5168.34] [Negative] [Oh,  it's  booted.]
[5168.44 - 5168.76] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[5168.90 - 5169.62] [Very Negative] [No  way.]
[5169.94 - 5171.82] [Neutral] [Is  this  at  6800  or  did  it  reset?]
[5171.82 - 5172.62] [Neutral] [I  didn't  check,  but  we  can  see.]
[5172.92 - 5173.42] [Neutral] [Yeah.]

[5175.78 - 5176.02] [Neutral] [Okay.]
[5176.66 - 5178.38] [Neutral] [Well,  that's  pretty  cool.]
[5178.38 - 5179.30] [Neutral] [We'll  see  how  stable  it  is.]
[5179.40 - 5179.66] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[5179.66 - 5180.82] [Neutral] [We  are  asking  a  lot.]
[5181.18 - 5181.68] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[5182.32 - 5183.56] [Neutral] [Oh,  1080p,  right?]
[5184.02 - 5184.84] [Neutral] [Yeah,  for  capture.]
[5185.02 - 5185.88] [Positive] [Yep,  that  makes  sense.]
[5185.88 - 5186.28] [Neutral] [Okay.]
[5186.30 - 5186.92] [Neutral] [And  we  need  to...]
[5187.08 - 5189.92] [Positive] [Dan's  going  to  come  over  and  connect  this  to  the  server,  so  we  can  open  our  project.]
[5189.96 - 5190.48] [Very Negative] [Heck  yeah.]
[5190.46 - 5191.74] [Neutral] [I  have  to  do  my  job.]
[5192.46 - 5192.92] [Neutral] [All  right.]
[5192.92 - 5196.90] [Negative] [I  don't  have  the  merch  message  panel  open,  so  I'm  gonna  hang  out  with  Flowplane  Chat  for  now.]
[5196.92 - 5198.30] [Very Positive] [Yo,  what  up,  Flowplane?]
[5199.04 - 5201.34] [Positive] [I  am  gonna  beat  GTA  6.]
[5201.82 - 5204.84] [Neutral] [My  bike  will  be  done  before  GTA  6  launches.]
[5204.84 - 5205.66] [Neutral] [I  promise  you  that.]
[5205.70 - 5205.94] [Very Negative] [You  have  to  the  fall.]
[5206.10 - 5206.92] [Very Negative] [It's  coming  out  this  fall.]
[5206.94 - 5207.56] [Neutral] [What?]
[5207.56 - 5208.46] [Very Negative] [It's  coming  out  this  fall.]
[5208.48 - 5208.94] [Neutral] [Shut  up.]
[5208.94 - 5210.56] [Neutral] [Yeah,  get  on  it.]
[5211.84 - 5216.24] [Neutral] [They  just  told  the  two  investors  that  it's  still  coming  2025.]
[5216.50 - 5217.54] [Neutral] [Oh,  okay.]
[5217.76 - 5223.04] [Very Negative] [Man,  it's  really  tough  because  like  it's  actually  really  hard  to  paint  with  the  tennis  elbow.]
[5223.92 - 5230.30] [Neutral] [The  gun  and  the  hose  and  then  the  hopper  and  all  the  different  angles  and  stuff.]
[5230.52 - 5236.22] [Positive] [So  I  don't  know  if  I've  really  talked  about  this  much,  but  I  developed  tennis  elbow  after  that  tournament  I  played  late  last  year.]
[5236.64 - 5243.62] [Neutral] [And  we're  now  in  February  of  this  year  and  it  is  still  causing  a  significant  amount  of  pain.]
[5243.52 - 5248.94] [Negative] [I  haven't  basically  been  able  to  play  badminton  since  Smash  Champs  fully  opened.]
[5249.64 - 5251.08] [Positive] [I  did  play  a  little  bit  last  night.]
[5251.58 - 5255.64] [Positive] [I  hit  one  smash  last  night  and  I'm  not  suffering  today.]
[5255.70 - 5256.16] [Very Positive] [Oh,  that's  good.]
[5256.24 - 5258.22] [Neutral] [So  I'm  wondering  if  the  physio  is  helping.]
[5258.38 - 5265.58] [Very Negative] [Tynan  actually  gave  me  this  thing,  which  looks  like  some  kind  of  medieval  torture  device  or  something.]
[5266.68 - 5269.16] [Neutral] [And  it  honestly  feels  like  one.]
[5269.90 - 5270.70] [Very Negative] [How  hard  are  these?]
[5270.90 - 5271.64] [Neutral] [They're  not  that  hard.]
[5271.64 - 5272.20] [Neutral] [Okay,  yeah.]
[5272.52 - 5276.78] [Neutral] [But  what  you  do  is  you  sit  like  this.]
[5277.20 - 5284.06] [Negative] [Because  what  I  learned  is  that  it's  not  actually  the  inflammation  that  is  the  problem  of  the  tendon.]
[5284.72 - 5287.02] [Neutral] [That's  ligaments  and  building  muscle  and  all  that.]
[5287.02 - 5290.46] [Negative] [So  the  micro  tears  are  not  what  cause  the  inflammation  and  the  pain.]
[5290.46 - 5301.56] [Negative] [It's  the  micro  tears  combined  with  an  overuse,  like  a  repetitive  strain  kind  of  overuse  of  the  muscles  on  either  side  that  are  pulling  it  apart.]
[5301.32 - 5331.58] [Neutral] [while  you  have  all  the  micro  tears  and  causing  the  inflammation  and  the  and  the  swelling  and  the  and  the  pain  so  what  you  have  to  do  and  you  use  this  thing  is  you  it's  what's  this  what's  this  weird  thing  called  rolf  roll  flex  not  two  l's  rolflex  not  rolflex  rolf  braflex  volflex  um  so  you  kind  of  like  you  kind  of  clamp  it  with  your  other  arm  and  you  kind  of  like  get  into  the  into  the  spot  You're  like,  oh,  it  hurts  so  much.]
[5331.60 - 5332.50] [Neutral] [But  like  the  good  hurt.]
[5332.64 - 5332.84] [Very Negative] [No.]
[5332.98 - 5333.26] [Very Negative] [No?]
[5333.32 - 5334.10] [Negative] [No,  it  hurts.]
[5334.12 - 5334.32] [Neutral] [Okay.]
[5334.54 - 5337.28] [Positive] [For  you,  it  probably  hurts,  yes,  because  you're  actually  injured.]
[5337.62 - 5339.84] [Negative] [And  you're  not  supposed  to  do  the  site  of  the  injury.]
[5340.18 - 5351.58] [Negative] [So  what  you're  supposed  to  do  is  you're  supposed  to  like  really  work  out  the  tension  that's  pulling  the  injury  site  apart  above  and  below  it.]
[5351.58 - 5355.68] [Neutral] [And  it's  kind  of  like,  you're  supposed  to  like  move  the  arm  around,  like  especially  down  here.]
[5356.08 - 5400.52] [Positive] [and  between  this  and  just  sort  of  getting  a  little  bit  better  at  identifying  the  right  spots  to  do  the  massage  it's  been  it's  been  helping  a  lot  i  also  did  some  physio  they  did  like  ultrasound  and  then  they  did  the  the  weird  one  where  they  hook  up  the  electrodes  to  it  and  it  like  like  like  that  they  did  it  a  little  bit  too  high  one  time  and  um  like  my  hand  got  stuck  like  this  and  i  was  like  come  on  and  then  anyway  uh  oh  hey  all  right  oh  it's  connected  to  the  server  we're  gonna  load  a  project  nice  conform  the  audio  beforehand  oh  okay  everything  was  just  so  rushed  this  morning  well  hey  we'll  see  how  uh  let's  see  how  it  goes  oh  hi  mark  hi  how  are  you  never  better  really  i  think  we  might  have  to  wait  which  computer  this  one  that  one  this  is  the  new  stations.]
[5400.52 - 5405.80] [Neutral] [So  we  wanted  to,  we  wanted  to  bring  one  of  our  editors  out  and  the  script  says  do  something.]
[5405.80 - 5406.96] [Neutral] [Uh,  okay.]
[5406.96 - 5409.02] [Very Negative] [We  won't  drag  race  the  premiere  between  the  two.]
[5409.02 - 5409.46] [Neutral] [Oh,  sure.]
[5409.46 - 5410.58] [Very Positive] [Just  premiere  on  this  one.]
[5410.58 - 5413.30] [Neutral] [So  basically  we  want  to  get  your,  oh,  you  can  turn  that  on.]
[5413.30 - 5422.88] [Neutral] [We  want  to  get  your  impression  of  if  this,  if  this  would  be  a,  if  we  took  your  workstation  away  tomorrow  and  we  gave  you  this,  would  you  be  happy,  sad,  or  somewhere  in  between?]
[5422.88 - 5424.08] [Very Positive] [Probably  happy.]
[5423.90 - 5509.68] [Neutral] [okay  yeah  you  could  you  can  you're  picking  up  the  vibe  now  that  i  was  talking  about  before  i'm  lost  oh  where  am  i  supposed  to  go  this  pc  huh  this  pc  there  we  go  ah  there  we  go  there  we  go  all  right  good  stuff  don't  open  the  hr  folder  we  are  live  is  he  miked  he's  my  yeah  oh  brilliant  wonderful  um  so  what  are  your  main  complaints  with  the  current  stations  i'm  going  to  switch  spots  with  you  okay  Andy  I'm  gonna  kind  of  stack  up  on  mark  here  actually  the  current  oh  no  you  yeah  there  you  go  the  current  ones  are  fine  oh  it  was  actually  the  thread  rippers  so  that  were  the  problem  the  current  ones  the  issue  is  there's  not  enough  VRAM  on  the  3090s  I  for  like  for  resolve  I  feel  like  we  need  to  upgrade  the  VRAM  oh  I  no  one  told  me  that  they  didn't  tell  me  you  needed  more  VRAM  so  these  are  5080s  they  have  less  VRAM  these  are  5080s  yeah  this  is  a  5080  less  VRAM  than  that  maybe  it's  just  better  VRAM  I  don't  know  okay  well  let's  see  let's  see  good  lord  well  okay  the  good  thing  is  we  don't  use  a  result  very  often  it's  usually  premiere  yeah  but  still  use  a  lot  of  so  wait  I  was  told  quick  sync  was  causing  stability  issues  though  quick  sync  or  just  the  Intel  once  had  stability  issues  so  that's  editors  that  have  been  having  daily  oh  Oh  yeah,  yeah,  okay,  yeah,  yeah,  I  can  see.]
[5510.14 - 5511.42] [Neutral] [That  might  be  the  issue.]
[5511.76 - 5516.98] [Very Negative] [I  know  that  Threadripper  was  causing  a  lot  more  issues  though  that  I  don't  even  know  what  they  were.]
[5517.14 - 5517.56] [Neutral] [Okay.]
[5517.60 - 5519.92] [Neutral] [Or  what  was  causing  it,  but...]
[5520.02 - 5529.50] [Very Negative] [So  basically,  there's  ghosts  living  in  computers  and  if  you  anger  the  ghosts,  they  will  punish  you.]
[5529.96 - 5535.14] [Neutral] [So  Mark  apparently  doesn't  mind  his  Intel  machine,  but  we  have  gotten  a  lot  of  complaints  from  the  other...]
[5535.14 - 5537.74] [Very Positive] [I  mean,  our  editing  team  is  almost  a  dozen  people  now,  I  think.]
[5537.96 - 5547.26] [Neutral] [So  even  if,  you  know,  10 %  of  systems  have  an  issue,  you  know,  that's  one  to  two  of  our  editors  is  going  to  have  a  problem  with  it,  right?]
[5548.70 - 5549.90] [Very Negative] [During  Scrapyard  Wars.]
[5550.24 - 5550.80] [Neutral] [Oh,  yeah.]
[5550.80 - 5558.76] [Negative] [During  Scrapyard  Wars,  we  would  have  late  night  editing  sessions  and  it  would  delay  us  like  an  hour  or  two  because  it  would  just  crash  consistently  and  we'd  have  to  reload.]
[5559.30 - 5560.04] [Neutral] [You're  just  waiting.]
[5560.38 - 5561.18] [Very Negative] [And  it  was  very  frustrating.]
[5561.18 - 5562.30] [Neutral] [And  that  was  on  the  Intel  systems.]
[5562.30 - 5563.18] [Neutral] [That  was  on  the  Intel  ones.]
[5563.18 - 5563.48] [Neutral] [Okay.]
[5563.58 - 5563.78] [Positive] [Hold  on.]
[5563.80 - 5564.42] [Neutral] [Give  me  one  second.]
[5564.42 - 5566.28] [Negative] [I'm  just  going  to  close  that.]
[5566.10 - 5569.90] [Neutral] [Are  you  just  like  looking  for  your  favorite  project  or?]
[5569.96 - 5571.68] [Neutral] [Yeah,  I'm  looking  for  the  one  I'm  working  on  right  now.]

[5574.86 - 5575.46] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[5575.46 - 5578.44] [Neutral] [On  the  amount  of  VRAM  you  thought  you  were  going  to  get  in  your  news  station.]
[5579.66 - 5580.34] [Very Positive] [I  was  hopeful.]
[5580.48 - 5582.44] [Negative] [I  heard  we  were  switching  to  50  series.]
[5582.56 - 5585.80] [Negative] [I  just  thought  it  was  going  to  be  equivalent  50  series.]
[5585.80 - 5589.52] [Negative] [I  was  more  interested  in  the  better  media  encoder.]
[5590.18 - 5593.06] [Neutral] [I  didn't  realize  you  guys  needed  a  ton  of  VRAM  for  resolve.]
[5593.24 - 5593.58] [Neutral] [Well.]
[5593.58 - 5594.34] [Neutral] [Click  okay.]
[5594.80 - 5595.16] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[5595.64 - 5597.14] [Neutral] [All  right,  sick  a  lot  of  it.]
[5597.14 - 5600.00] [Neutral] [I  think  is  just  resolve  optimization  issues.]
[5600.00 - 5617.68] [Neutral] [Okay  Linus  would  you  just  open  your  shirt  a  bit  you're  rubbing  quite  heavily  Sorry  about  that  is  that  better  one  more  one  more  more  much  sure  some  seriously  I'm  going  full  like  full  Italian  yeah  There  you  go.]

[5619.22 - 5630.02] [Neutral] [I  don't  edit  so  So,  okay,  so  Mark,  you  have  to  come  this  way,  and  then  Andy,  no,  no,  no,  yeah,  there  you  go,  and  then  Andy  goes  over  there,  and  then,  no,  no,  you  still  use  the  computer,  no,  no,  but  with  your  right  hand.]
[5631.12 - 5636.78] [Neutral] [This  is  what  happens  when  we  let  not  on -camera  people  on  camera,  there  you  go,  just  like  that,  and  then  I  go  right  here.]
[5636.98 - 5638.60] [Very Positive] [He's  an  on -camera  people  now.]
[5638.96 - 5639.42] [Positive] [It's  good.]
[5639.68 - 5643.12] [Neutral] [And  then  when  you  talk  to  me,  you  just  kind  of  turn  your  head  this  way,  but  don't  bother  looking  at  me,  it's  fine.]
[5643.12 - 5643.64] [Positive] [Got  it.]

[5818.04 - 5819.96] [Neutral] [Yeah  I  mean  you  could  do  whatever  you  want.]
[5819.96 - 5820.40] [Very Negative] [Actually  no.]
[5820.40 - 5820.64] [Neutral] [Free  country.]
[5820.64 - 5822.40] [Neutral] [Maybe  just  a  render.]
[5822.40 - 5824.22] [Neutral] [Wait  what?]
[5825.80 - 5827.18] [Neutral] [That's  control  right?]
[5827.18 - 5830.02] [Negative] [Oh  it  doesn't  have  my  keyboard  shortcuts.]
[5830.02 - 5831.12] [Very Positive] [Oh  that  yeah  that  makes  sense.]
[5831.12 - 5833.48] [Neutral] [One  sec,  one  sec.]
[5833.48 - 5836.70] [Neutral] [No,  no.]
[5836.70 - 5838.12] [Neutral] [Okay,  here  we  go.]
[5838.12 - 5840.08] [Neutral] [So  what  are  you  expecting  here?]
[5840.34 - 5841.66] [Very Negative] [Nothing.]
[5841.66 - 5842.78] [Positive] [Okay,  cool.]
[5842.78 - 5850.28] [Neutral] [I'm  not  entirely  sure  what  I  should  be  expecting,  but  it  seems  to  be  rendering  on  par  with  what  we  have  at  least.]
[5850.28 - 5850.94] [Neutral] [Okay.]
[5850.94 - 5852.78] [Positive] [Yeah,  it's  pretty  good.]
[5852.78 - 5863.62] [Negative] [Okay,  so  if  this  could  solve  some  of  the  stability  issues  that  some  of  the  other  folks  are  having,  would  you  be,  are  we  really  seeing  90 %  usage  of  that  RTX  5080?]
[5864.12 - 5865.62] [Neutral] [Oh,  yeah.]
[5867.22 - 5869.90] [Neutral] [Premiere  is  GPU  optimized  now.]
[5870.26 - 5871.12] [Very Negative] [She's  hungry.]
[5871.18 - 5871.50] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[5871.50 - 5871.96] [Neutral] [Oh,  yeah.]
[5872.06 - 5873.38] [Very Negative] [She's  a  hungry  boy.]
[5873.38 - 5874.22] [Neutral] [That's  what  I  was  saying.]
[5874.68 - 5875.62] [Very Positive] [Oh,  my  God.]
[5875.62 - 5877.66] [Very Positive] [We're  capping  out  our  memory.]
[5877.88 - 5878.36] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[5878.36 - 5879.06] [Neutral] [Just  about.]
[5879.62 - 5880.46] [Very Negative] [Oh,  crap.]
[5880.48 - 5881.44] [Neutral] [Maybe  we  need  5090.]
[5881.74 - 5883.04] [Very Negative] [Oh,  crap.]
[5883.30 - 5884.78] [Very Positive] [I  thought  you  knew  this,  Linus.]
[5884.80 - 5886.02] [Very Negative] [No,  I  didn't  know  this.]
[5885.92 - 5889.18] [Negative] [I  thought  the  5080s  were  going  to  be  okay  for  the  editing  stations.]
[5889.42 - 5891.76] [Neutral] [Isn't  there  something  higher  than  the  5090,  though?]
[5891.90 - 5892.26] [Very Negative] [No.]
[5892.28 - 5893.54] [Neutral] [Well,  no.]
[5894.38 - 5895.34] [Neutral] [No,  there  isn't.]
[5895.64 - 5897.02] [Negative] [Not  that  cost  less  than  like  $10.]
[5897.62 - 5898.74] [Neutral] [Nope,  there  isn't.]
[5899.72 - 5901.68] [Very Negative] [No,  didn't  they  call  those  quadros  before?]
[5901.72 - 5903.18] [Very Negative] [Nope,  I  don't  know  what  you're  talking  about.]
[5903.18 - 5904.46] [Neutral] [The  5100s.]
[5904.94 - 5906.24] [Very Negative] [Oh,  man.]
[5906.74 - 5908.48] [Very Negative] [Oh,  this  blows.]
[5909.06 - 5910.84] [Neutral] [How  many  desks  are  in  here?]
[5911.10 - 5911.78] [Neutral] [13.]
[5911.84 - 5912.48] [Very Positive] [Dang  it.]
[5912.88 - 5913.48] [Very Positive] [Dang  it.]
[5913.76 - 5914.44] [Neutral] [Lucky  13.]
[5914.24 - 5917.70] [Neutral] [This  is  because  you  put  the  panels  on.]
[5920.06 - 5925.12] [Neutral] [Even  at  MSRP,  that's  another  $13 ,000  US  dollars.]
[5925.48 - 5928.48] [Very Negative] [And  ain't  nobody  getting  any  5090s  at  MSRP.]
[5929.46 - 5930.04] [Neutral] [How  many  did  you  pay?]
[5930.24 - 5930.68] [Very Positive] [13 ,000?]
[5930.76 - 5932.24] [Neutral] [Yeah,  because  one  for  every  system.]
[5932.24 - 5933.40] [Very Negative] [Aren't  they  $1 ,800?]
[5933.98 - 5936.78] [Neutral] [Well,  they're  $2 ,000.]
[5936.96 - 5937.42] [Neutral] [$2 ,000.]
[5937.46 - 5938.18] [Very Negative] [Nobody  has  an  MSRP.]
[5938.32 - 5940.92] [Neutral] [But  5080s,  $1 ,000.]
[5940.92 - 5941.14] [Neutral] [Oh,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.]
[5941.12 - 5945.08] [Neutral] [Yeah,  so  I'm  talking  the  additional  cost  over  the  5080.]
[5945.64 - 5946.38] [Neutral] [I  have  an  idea.]
[5946.54 - 5947.76] [Positive] [Look  what  you  did,  Mark.]
[5948.06 - 5949.26] [Negative] [You  little  jerk.]
[5949.34 - 5953.84] [Neutral] [What  if  you  get  two  5080s  and  you  got  like,  what  is  it  called?]
[5953.84 - 5954.26] [Neutral] [SLI?]
[5954.32 - 5955.94] [Negative] [Yeah,  we  don't  have  SLI  anymore.]
[5956.42 - 5957.14] [Neutral] [EnvyLink?]
[5957.46 - 5958.80] [Neutral] [No,  no  EnvyLink  anymore.]
[5959.30 - 5960.82] [Negative] [Not  on  the  consumer  cards.]
[5961.20 - 5963.72] [Neutral] [Also,  you  need  a  monster  case  to  fit  two  of  those  in  there.]
[5963.80 - 5965.22] [Neutral] [Yeah,  no  kidding.]
[5966.40 - 5969.50] [Very Negative] [Oh,  this  blows.]
[5970.60 - 5971.56] [Very Positive] [Dang  it.]
[5973.54 - 5974.92] [Neutral] [I  mean,  it's  workable.]
[5975.12 - 5976.56] [Negative] [It's  not  gonna  be  the  end  of  the  world.]
[5976.62 - 5978.00] [Negative] [Yeah,  I  don't  want  workable.]
[5978.00 - 5980.80] [Very Positive] [I  want  good,  you  know?]
[5980.92 - 5982.64] [Positive] [Yeah,  Apple  is  really  solid.]
[5982.66 - 5983.90] [Very Positive] [Oh  yeah,  he's  an  Apple  fan.]
[5984.36 - 5987.54] [Very Positive] [We  actually  have  a  video  coming  out  very  soon.]
[5987.64 - 5989.50] [Neutral] [Linus  switches  to  Mac  for  a  month.]
[5989.82 - 5995.46] [Positive] [And  I  believe  it's  probably  gonna  be  coming  out  this  weekend,  the  shopping  segment.]
[5995.46 - 6000.94] [Positive] [And  Mark  was  sort  of  our  resident  advisor  to  make  sure  that  we  pick  the  right  Mac.]
[6000.94 - 6003.58] [Very Negative] [So  I  ended  up,  dude,  I'm  so  upset.]
[6003.58 - 6010.84] [Positive] [So  I  ended  up  with  a  MacBook  Air  with  an  M3,  and  I  think  I  went  with  16  gigs  of  RAM,  which  I  think  will  be  enough  for  me  for  mobile.]
[6011.40 - 6013.72] [Neutral] [So  I  went  with  the  Mac  Mini,  the  M4  Mac  Mini.]
[6013.72 - 6020.84] [Neutral] [Just  this  week,  Apple  announced  that  they're  doing  first -party  refurb  M4  Mac  Minis.]
[6020.84 - 6022.84] [Very Negative] [I  would  have  bought  a  refurb.]
[6022.84 - 6023.50] [Neutral] [Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.]
[6023.50 - 6025.46] [Neutral] [M4  Mac  Yeah.]
[6025.66 - 6026.30] [Very Positive] [Wow.]
[6026.30 - 6026.78] [Neutral] [Already?]
[6027.00 - 6027.58] [Neutral] [Already.]
[6027.70 - 6028.94] [Neutral] [What  are  you  refurbing?]
[6029.00 - 6029.62] [Neutral] [Well,  I  don't  know.]
[6030.00 - 6030.42] [Very Positive] [Exactly.]
[6030.96 - 6037.32] [Negative] [But  that  concerns  me  because  like  how  many  Mac  Minis,  M4  Mac  Minis  have  been  refurbished?]
[6037.68 - 6041.36] [Very Negative] [No,  I  think  they're  just,  dude,  I  think  they're  just  selling  a  butt  ton  of  these  things.]
[6041.70 - 6050.66] [Neutral] [And  I  think  that,  you  know,  anytime  you  sell  a  butt  ton  of  something,  you're  going  to,  even  if  1 %  of  people  don't  like  it,  if  you  sell  a  million  of  them,  that's  100 ,000  returns.]
[6050.70 - 6052.10] [Neutral] [Sorry,  10 ,000  returns.]
[6053.30 - 6056.78] [Neutral] [So  I  think  it's  just  a  natural  part  of  doing  a  high  volume  business.]
[6056.78 - 6060.48] [Very Positive] [So  with  that  in  mind,  like,  dude,  I'd  have  bought  one  of  those  no  problem.]
[6060.48 - 6061.88] [Positive] [I  would  have  totally  saved  a  few  bucks.]
[6062.28 - 6068.84] [Very Negative] [So  part  of  the  premise  was  that  I  wasn't  allowed  to  just  shop  for  a  Mac  just  by  grabbing  one  out  of  our  warehouse.]
[6069.04 - 6071.44] [Positive] [I  had  to  actually  buy  it  after  I  settled  on  it.]
[6071.44 - 6076.06] [Negative] [So  I  ended  up  cheaping  out  a  little  bit  more  than  I  would  have  if  I  just  grabbed  whatever  I  wanted.]
[6076.06 - 6080.34] [Neutral] [But  so  would  you  be  interested  in  moving  to  Mac  minis  or  Mac  studios?]
[6081.94 - 6083.26] [Neutral] [Yeah,  I  wouldn't  be  opposed  to  it.]
[6085.46 - 6093.76] [Neutral] [I  mean,  cost  analysis  here,  like  Mac  Mini  M4  versus  like  readily  available?]
[6093.88 - 6094.80] [Neutral] [Okay,  tell  me  this.]
[6095.22 - 6102.80] [Neutral] [Is  there  anything  that  you  do  that  would  benefit  from  having  like  a  fatter,  because  this  is  a  way  more  powerful  system  than  the  Mac  Mini  in  any  configuration.]
[6103.10 - 6103.36] [Neutral] [Right.]
[6103.56 - 6107.00] [Neutral] [Is  there  anything  that  you  do  that  would  benefit  from  just  more  raw  horsepower?]
[6109.28 - 6111.62] [Negative] [Not  now  that  we're  off  the  RED  cameras.]
[6112.02 - 6141.00] [Neutral] [okay  but  it's  not  like  we  don't  still  have  them  if  we  pulled  them  out  of  mothballs  for  a  project  would  you  would  you  wish  you  had  more  power  i  think  okay  i  hate  to  say  this  because  i  will  you  can  never  have  too  much  power  when  you're  editing  uh  so  it  depends  on  what  we're  doing  so  right  complex  effects  layers  and  layers  of  animations  it  can  it  can  really  or  keying  Keying  is  another  big  one.]
[6141.30 - 6145.78] [Neutral] [Right,  so  whether  that's  for  tech  linked  or  if  and  when  we  bring  TechQuickie  back.]
[6145.78 - 6145.98] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[6146.72 - 6148.30] [Negative] [We  haven't  needed  to  do  it  much.]
[6148.30 - 6149.98] [Negative] [There's  not  many  LTTs  that  call  for  it.]
[6150.10 - 6150.52] [Neutral] [Right.]
[6150.90 - 6153.76] [Very Positive] [And  we  have  the  Ultimat  now  too  that  can  handle  that.]
[6153.94 - 6159.70] [Positive] [So  that  does  the  keying  in  the  box  at  the  point  of  recording,  which  is  so  cool.]
[6160.42 - 6162.72] [Very Positive] [That  was  a  smart  acquisition  by  Blackmagic.]
[6162.72 - 6163.84] [Very Positive] [That  thing  is  so  cool.]
[6164.50 - 6168.30] [Neutral] [So  honestly,  I  think  this  would  be  enough.]
[6168.76 - 6179.98] [Positive] [would  be  enough  yeah  oh  like  you  don't  need  oh  sorry  i  was  talking  mac  mini  versus  this  would  you  be  happy  to  have  the  extra  power  of  this  oh  yeah  i  wasn't  even  talking  about  50  90  so  you  do  you  think  i  could  get  away  with  50  80.]
[6179.98 - 6198.54] [Negative] [here's  the  problem  if  we  switch  to  mac  minis  it  would  be  a  very  contentious  subject  we  are  as  editors  we  are  split  pretty  much  50  50  apple  and  pc  users  at  home  and  i  know  the  pc  users  at  home  would  be  a  lot  more  upset  working  at  linus  tech  tips  with  Mac  minis.]
[6198.98 - 6200.68] [Neutral] [That's  true.]
[6200.68 - 6202.64] [Negative] [The  optics  aren't  the  greatest.]
[6202.92 - 6203.98] [Neutral] [Okay,  that's  fair.]
[6204.30 - 6206.00] [Neutral] [All  right.]
[6206.18 - 6209.36] [Very Positive] [Well,  anyway,  thank  you,  Mark,  for  coming  and  sort  of  talking  us  through  this.]
[6209.36 - 6214.06] [Neutral] [It  looks  like  there's  no  obvious  game -breaking  issues,  at  least  here  out  of  the  gate.]
[6214.86 - 6219.06] [Negative] [Other  than  that,  our  VRAM  usage  is  higher  than  I  anticipated.]
[6219.06 - 6219.50] [Negative] [It's  come  down.]
[6219.62 - 6222.82] [Negative] [It's  come  down  a  little  bit,  but  come  down  now  doesn't  help  me.]
[6223.22 - 6285.10] [Very Positive] [I  need  it  to  be,  like  if  that's  what  we  needed  at  the  beginning  of  the  render  then  that's  what  we  need  so  we  may  be  seriously  considering  50  90s  rather  than  50  80s  so  uh  all  right  thank  you  very  much  now  since  we're  here  uh  i  don't  know  should  we  fire  up  a  game  on  it  yeah  all  right  cool  thanks  mark  all  right  i'm  just  going  to  cancel  that  it's  very  responsive  i  know  that's  something  that  used  to  be  a  big  issue  on  lesser  systems  in  particular  with  premieres  like  when  you  cancel  something  it  could  take  a  hot  minute  to  decide  that  it's  ready  to  actually  cancel  man  that  is  good  lord  is  timeline  performance  ever  smooth  on  a  brand  new  machine  these  days  sorry  this  is  i  this  is  my  first  time  touching  it  was  that  full  res  uh  that's  that  full  res  yeah  4k  please  wow  there's  like  no  lag  that's  pretty  cool  all  right  so  was  the  idea  that  we  would  we  would  both  game  side  by  side  on  the  system?]
[6285.10 - 6285.56] [Neutral] [Sure.]
[6285.56 - 6286.34] [Neutral] [Why  not?]
[6286.34 - 6292.14] [Negative] [In  that  case,  Dan,  do  you  want  to  hit  us  with  some  merch  messages  since  we're  just  kind  of  killing  time  hanging  out  with  these  people  right  now  anyway?]
[6292.14 - 6292.86] [Neutral] [Yeah,  sure.]
[6292.86 - 6294.12] [Positive] [I  think  that  sounds  like  a  good  idea.]
[6294.12 - 6294.56] [Neutral] [Sure.]
[6294.56 - 6295.88] [Very Positive] [Hello,  Linus  and  Dan.]
[6295.88 - 6301.24] [Negative] [With  a  huge  gap  between  the  5080  and  5090,  should  I  wait  for  the  5080  Ti  with  more  VRAM?]
[6301.44 - 6310.48] [Negative] [I'm  coming  from  a  3080  10G  and  the  need  for  more  VRAM  is  scaring  me  that  16  gigabytes  is  not  enough.]
[6313.50 - 6318.58] [Neutral] [I  don't  know  if  a  5080  class  card  with  more  VRAM  is  going  to  be  in  your  future.]
[6319.80 - 6320.60] [Negative] [That's  the  concern.]
[6320.86 - 6328.02] [Very Positive] [And  you  can  really  see  how  NVIDIA  has  strategically  chosen  16  gigs.]
[6328.98 - 6334.92] [Neutral] [It  happens  to  be  the  amount  of  unified  memory  in  both  current  generation  consoles.]
[6335.68 - 6336.66] [Neutral] [Happens  to  be.]
[6337.34 - 6341.34] [Neutral] [So  we're  still  at  the  point  in  the  PS5  and  Xbox.]
[6341.34 - 6342.40] [Positive] [Would  you  like  me  to  help  you  with  that,  Andy?]
[6342.46 - 6342.98] [Neutral] [No,  it's  good.]
[6342.96 - 6357.92] [Negative] [We  are  still  at  the  point  in  the  series'  and  the  PS5's  life  cycle  where  game  development  is  probably  not  focused  on  a  next  generation  PlayStation  6  or  Xbox,  whatever  the  crap  they  end  up  calling  it.]
[6358.46 - 6367.18] [Very Positive] [So,  NVIDIA,  knowing  this,  knows  that  no  game  developer  in  their  right  mind  is  going  to  be  targeting  more  than  16  gigs  of  memory.]
[6368.28 - 6372.24] [Negative] [So  there  is  no  need  for  them  to  put  in  more.]
[6372.12 - 6380.32] [Neutral] [Yes,  if  you  wanted  to  crank  texture  resolution  or  if  you  wanted  to  run  advanced  features,  there  could  be  a  benefit  to  additional  VRAM.]
[6380.66 - 6383.32] [Neutral] [And  we've  seen  that  even  today.]
[6384.24 - 6386.16] [Neutral] [But  there's  no  need.]
[6386.42 - 6395.34] [Negative] [And  they're  way  more  interested  in  pursuing  things  like  AI  compression  techniques  to  bring  down  VRAM  usage  rather  than  putting  more  VRAM  on  the  card.]
[6395.34 - 6400.18] [Negative] [Because  an  AI  compression  technique  costs  them  development  time  once.]
[6400.00 - 6405.28] [Negative] [more  VRAM  on  the  card  costs  them  VRAM  every  single  time  they  build  a  card.]
[6405.48 - 6409.90] [Positive] [So  it's  in  their  best  interest  to  see  if  they  can  just  develop  their  way  around  it.]
[6410.48 - 6421.96] [Neutral] [So  with  that  in  mind,  even  if  we  do  get  a  mid -life  cycle  refresh,  unless  it  happens  to  coincide  with  like  a  new  console  generation,  which  probably,  what,  two  years?]
[6422.04 - 6422.86] [Neutral] [Three  years  maybe  even?]
[6422.86 - 6424.04] [Neutral] [I  think  at  least  three  years.]
[6424.04 - 6427.82] [Negative] [It  feels  like  the  current  gen  is  like  just  getting  its  wings.]
[6430.28 - 6433.10] [Negative] [NVIDIA  has  no  motivation  to  put  more  than  16  gigs  of  RAM  on.]
[6433.40 - 6440.26] [Very Positive] [The  32  gig  5090  is  obviously  a  budget  AI  play  and  an  enthusiast  play  and  it's  priced  as  such.]
[6440.68 - 6447.78] [Positive] [The  5080  is  the  gaming  flagship  and  they  have  deemed  it  thusly  that  16  gigs  is  enough.]
[6447.78 - 6449.68] [Negative] [Now  AMD  might  come  and  be  disruptive.]
[6449.88 - 6454.18] [Very Negative] [I  think  the  word  on  the  street  is  that  the,  oh  man,  what  is  the  stupid  thing  called?]
[6455.36 - 6456.18] [Very Negative] [What's  it  called?]
[6456.52 - 6458.88] [Neutral] [9070,  what's  the  new  AMD  card?]
[6458.90 - 6459.44] [Neutral] [Oh,  9070  XT.]
[6459.52 - 6460.60] [Neutral] [9070  XT.]
[6461.20 - 6464.44] [Negative] [There's  some  rumors  that  it  could  be  equipped  with  up  to  32  gigs  of  RAM.]
[6464.84 - 6468.36] [Negative] [There's  gonna  be  a  card  that's  in  that  class  with  32,  not  the  base  one.]
[6468.46 - 6468.94] [Positive] [Got  it.]
[6469.64 - 6472.52] [Neutral] [Is  that  confirmed  or  is  that  still  very -  No,  we're  still  rumored  down.]
[6472.60 - 6473.78] [Neutral] [Oh,  frame  view.]
[6474.18 - 6475.22] [Neutral] [Oh,  yes.]
[6477.06 - 6481.42] [Negative] [But  that  doesn't  help  you  if  you  want  an  NVIDIA  card,  basically.]
[6482.42 - 6485.68] [Neutral] [Why  am  I  changing  my,  Why  am  I  reloading  in  the  middle  of  the  thing?]
[6486.64 - 6488.98] [Very Positive] [Ba  ba  ba  ba  ba,  oh,  oh,  goodness,  I  swear.]
[6488.98 - 6489.74] [Neutral] [Okay.]
[6489.92 - 6491.34] [Neutral] [I  was  like,  is  that  40  frames?]
[6491.90 - 6492.80] [Neutral] [No,  no,  no.]
[6493.78 - 6494.66] [Neutral] [Man,  we  are.]
[6494.76 - 6495.58] [Positive] [Pretty  damn  close.]
[6495.64 - 6498.36] [Very Positive] [We  are  actually  surprisingly  close.]
[6499.12 - 6501.24] [Neutral] [All  things  considered,  we  are  at  the  same  settings.]
[6501.24 - 6502.82] [Neutral] [I  mean,  we're  at  1080p  anyway,  right?]
[6502.82 - 6503.04] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[6503.54 - 6506.74] [Negative] [And  we're  far  past  the  point  of  dimensioning  returns.]
[6507.54 - 6508.28] [Neutral] [Yep.]
[6510.00 - 6515.34] [Very Positive] [Dude,  we  were  thinking  of  doing  like  a  thousand  FPS  gaming  PC,  you  know,  getting  like  a  9800X3D.]
[6515.36 - 6516.50] [Very Positive] [Come  on,  come  on  over  here.]
[6516.60 - 6517.36] [Very Positive] [Come  on,  get  over  here.]
[6517.36 - 6518.00] [Neutral] [Give  it  a  bit.]
[6519.10 - 6520.82] [Very Negative] [And  like  trying  to,  oh  boy.]
[6520.98 - 6524.46] [Neutral] [Is  it  possible  on  modern  competitive  games  to  get  a  thousand?]
[6524.50 - 6526.54] [Neutral] [Well,  that  was  the  question  we  were  going  to  try  and  answer.]
[6527.06 - 6534.78] [Neutral] [With  like  a  tuned  9800X3D  plus  an  RTX  5090,  could  we  actually  run  at  a  thousand  FPS?]
[6534.78 - 6539.28] [Positive] [So  right  now,  it  might  be  that  you're  helped  out  because  I  don't  have  any  AI  because  it's  a  training  session.]
[6539.70 - 6541.00] [Neutral] [I  have  to  do  this  before  I  can  play  it.]
[6541.00 - 6542.46] [Neutral] [Or  there's  very  few  AI.]
[6544.74 - 6545.16] [Very Negative] [I  don't  know.]
[6545.16 - 6545.62] [Neutral] [There's...]
[6545.68 - 6548.90] [Negative] [This  just  isn't  actually  running  that  fast.]
[6548.90 - 6550.82] [Neutral] [I  don't  still  have  Premiere  open  in  the  background  or  anything,  do  I?]
[6550.84 - 6551.30] [Very Negative] [I  don't.]
[6551.90 - 6552.32] [Very Negative] [I  don't  know.]
[6552.32 - 6556.10] [Negative] [I  was  expecting  more  than  500  FPS.]
[6556.28 - 6556.68] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[6556.94 - 6558.20] [Neutral] [Is  there  something  going  on?]
[6559.84 - 6560.34] [Very Negative] [Nope.]
[6560.62 - 6561.44] [Neutral] [I  just  checked.]
[6561.86 - 6563.34] [Neutral] [Maybe  I  messed  up  the  settings.]
[6563.34 - 6564.26] [Neutral] [Let's  just  double  check.]
[6564.44 - 6564.92] [Neutral] [Sure,  yeah.]
[6565.00 - 6565.60] [Neutral] [We  can  do  that.]
[6565.62 - 6567.92] [Neutral] [Okay,  so  video,  1080p.]
[6568.52 - 6570.48] [Negative] [It  could  just  be  CPU  bottlenecked,  man.]
[6570.50 - 6571.46] [Neutral] [Yeah,  maybe.]
[6571.88 - 6573.56] [Neutral] [Just  check  if  you're  actually  1080p.]
[6573.42 - 6574.76] [Positive] [Maybe  it's  4K  somehow.]
[6575.16 - 6576.76] [Negative] [I  don't  think  so.]
[6576.96 - 6577.78] [Neutral] [Yeah,  1080p.]
[6577.86 - 6578.52] [Neutral] [Advanced  video.]
[6578.60 - 6580.28] [Neutral] [It  should  be  medium  except  everything.]
[6580.44 - 6581.56] [Very Positive] [Let's  just  do  it  again.]
[6581.58 - 6585.70] [Neutral] [So  hit  medium  and  then  turn  off  FSR  at  the  bottom.]
[6586.72 - 6588.24] [Neutral] [Wow,  that's  default,  eh?]
[6588.26 - 6589.76] [Neutral] [I  know,  it's  crazy.]
[6590.14 - 6597.96] [Very Positive] [Even,  man,  even  in  a  competitive  game,  the  perception  around  upscaling  techniques  is  really  changing.]
[6597.96 - 6600.62] [Neutral] [And  I'm  not  sure  if...]
[6600.00 - 6601.06] [Neutral] [if  I'm  here  for  it.]
[6601.44 - 6603.92] [Neutral] [I'm  gonna  have  to  get  on  board  because  it's  just  a  happening.]
[6604.08 - 6604.88] [Very Negative] [I  don't  hate  it.]
[6604.88 - 6609.66] [Negative] [I  sit  far  enough  away  from  my  displays  that  I  don't  really  mind  it.]
[6609.66 - 6614.00] [Positive] [Like  I  play,  I'm  playing  The  Witcher  3  right  now  and  I  have  FSR  on.]
[6614.58 - 6615.44] [Very Positive] [Interesting.]
[6615.68 - 6631.64] [Neutral] [I  mean,  Ploof  meanwhile  is  like  militantly  against  it,  except  in  our  recent  videos  looking  at  4K  and  8K  gaming  on  the  5090,  there  was  one  or  two  games  that  he  was  like,  I  would  turn  it  on.]
[6632.10 - 6632.58] [Very Negative] [Really?]
[6632.66 - 6634.66] [Very Negative] [No  frame  gen  for  him,  at  least  not  yet.]
[6635.14 - 6642.10] [Neutral] [But  DLSS,  yep,  there  was  a  couple  games  where  he  at  least  thought  about  it  and  one  where  he  confirmed,  yeah,  I  would  turn  it  on.]
[6642.20 - 6642.52] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[6643.02 - 6645.16] [Neutral] [Which  is,  if  you  know  that  guy.]
[6645.84 - 6646.50] [Neutral] [Big  deal.]
[6646.56 - 6650.44] [Positive] [Yeah,  it's  a  big  shift  for  him.]
[6650.76 - 6651.26] [Neutral] [Okay.]
[6651.60 - 6654.60] [Neutral] [Well,  now  we're  just  playing  games  and  it's  pretty  on  par.]
[6654.60 - 6656.42] [Positive] [I  think  you  might  have  a  slight  edge,  actually.]
[6656.52 - 6657.80] [Neutral] [Yeah,  I  mean,  I  should.]
[6657.54 - 6659.54] [Positive] [Right  now  I'm  a  little  bit  ahead,  but  like.]
[6659.60 - 6661.66] [Neutral] [Given  I'm  running  it,  yeah,  you  are  actually.]
[6661.66 - 6663.28] [Neutral] [I  mean,  let  me  go  to  the  same  spot  on  the  map.]
[6664.18 - 6665.86] [Negative] [Maybe  that  has  a  bigger  difference  than  I  realized.]
[6665.88 - 6667.26] [Neutral] [Is  a  non -X3D,  yeah,  I  don't  know.]
[6667.26 - 6668.20] [Very Negative] [Do  you  wanna  come  over  here?]
[6668.24 - 6668.62] [Neutral] [Yep.]
[6668.62 - 6673.44] [Negative] [Is  a  non -X3D  chip  really  gonna  take  the  AMD  advantage  away  that  much?]
[6673.50 - 6674.18] [Neutral] [It's  possible.]
[6677.80 - 6678.96] [Very Negative] [Oh  my  goodness,  I  suck.]
[6679.54 - 6680.94] [Very Positive] [Thank  goodness  no  one  saw  that.]
[6681.26 - 6682.20] [Very Positive] [Oh  my  goodness.]
[6682.72 - 6684.52] [Very Negative] [Oh  wow,  I  just  got  killed  by  a  boy.]
[6685.08 - 6686.44] [Very Negative] [That  was  embarrassing.]
[6686.22 - 6687.84] [Very Negative] [all  the  way  here  just  for  nothing.]
[6687.90 - 6689.08] [Very Negative] [That  was  embarrassing.]
[6690.42 - 6691.44] [Negative] [Losing  the  bots  is  not  there.]
[6691.44 - 6692.80] [Neutral] [Ba -bow,  ba -bow.]
[6692.84 - 6695.36] [Negative] [I'm  about  to  run  out  of  time.]
[6700.04 - 6701.26] [Neutral] [All  right,  don't  worry,  I  got  this.]
[6701.80 - 6703.28] [Positive] [I  got  my  pea  shooter.]
[6703.72 - 6704.36] [Neutral] [Let's  go.]
[6705.00 - 6708.90] [Neutral] [So  I  mean,  yeah,  it's  without  AI,  we're  pretty  dang  close.]
[6711.00 - 6712.02] [Neutral] [Okay,  where  are  we  at?]
[6712.02 - 6713.34] [Neutral] [I  responded.]
[6713.34 - 6714.50] [Very Negative] [Oh,  gosh  darn  it.]
[6715.40 - 6716.72] [Neutral] [Okay,  I'm  heading  back  toward  you.]
[6716.96 - 6717.38] [Very Negative] [To  me?]
[6717.38 - 6717.62] [Neutral] [Okay.]
[6717.74 - 6718.18] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[6719.66 - 6721.06] [Very Negative] [Are  you  just  playing  deathmatch?]
[6721.80 - 6723.24] [Neutral] [It's  the  training  mode  still.]
[6723.46 - 6725.34] [Very Positive] [Oh,  sheesh.]
[6725.92 - 6727.48] [Negative] [That  is  so  annoying.]
[6727.48 - 6728.42] [Negative] [It's  really  annoying.]
[6728.64 - 6735.72] [Neutral] [I  understand  why  they  do  it  because  it  can  be  really  frustrating  for  more  experienced  players  to  have  people  drop  in  the  match  and  just  think  they're  gonna  learn  on  the  fly.]
[6735.72 - 6736.34] [Neutral] [Yeah,  no.]
[6736.48 - 6739.20] [Neutral] [Like,  you  know,  have  the  bomb  and  not  know  how  to  plant  that  stuff.]
[6739.20 - 6739.84] [Very Positive] [Oh,  you're  past  where  I  am.]
[6740.02 - 6741.76] [Negative] [Yeah,  I  just  needed  to  kill  that  guy  in  case.]
[6741.76 - 6742.40] [Neutral] [Oh,  shoot.]
[6742.48 - 6743.34] [Neutral] [Okay,  I'm  coming,  I'm  coming.]
[6743.50 - 6746.98] [Very Negative] [Oh,  please  don't  make  me  wait  the  whole  round.]
[6746.98 - 6747.80] [Very Negative] [This  is  embarrassing.]
[6748.12 - 6749.64] [Positive] [Dan,  do  you  want  to  hand  us  with  a  merch  message?]
[6749.84 - 6750.52] [Neutral] [Yeah,  sure.]
[6751.12 - 6760.06] [Very Negative] [As  someone  who  is  taking  my  first  serious  crack  at  switching  from  Windows  to  Linux,  have  you  ever  considered  a  follow -up  on  your  covert  era  Linux  challenge?]
[6760.32 - 6761.24] [Neutral] [And  if  not,  why?]
[6761.70 - 6762.20] [Neutral] [Yes.]
[6762.52 - 6767.36] [Neutral] [We  are  going  to  do  a  follow -up  to  the  Linux  challenge  once  SteamOS  goes  gold.]
[6768.16 - 6769.42] [Very Positive] [I'm  so  ready  for  it.]
[6769.64 - 6770.16] [Neutral] [Okay,  I'm  here.]
[6770.16 - 6770.50] [Neutral] [I'm  here.]
[6770.58 - 6770.86] [Neutral] [I'm  here.]
[6770.90 - 6771.84] [Neutral] [I'm  going  to  die.]
[6771.96 - 6772.74] [Very Negative] [I  died.]
[6773.50 - 6777.66] [Very Positive] [Oh  my  goodness.]
[6777.70 - 6778.26] [Very Positive] [I'm  coming  back.]
[6778.40 - 6778.92] [Very Positive] [I'm  coming  back.]
[6779.06 - 6779.78] [Neutral] [I'm  coming  up  there.]
[6780.78 - 6781.56] [Positive] [Dan,  hit  me  again.]
[6781.64 - 6782.86] [Neutral] [Sure,  sure,  sure,  sure.]
[6783.12 - 6784.38] [Very Positive] [Last  one  I've  got  for  you  here.]
[6784.66 - 6788.50] [Neutral] [Will  there  be  an  HDD  revisit  for  2025  games?]
[6788.50 - 6792.80] [Neutral] [Maybe  not  just  for  2024  hard  drives,  but  early  SATA  or  IDE.]
[6793.12 - 6795.80] [Neutral] [My  upgrade  cycle  for  storage  is  when  it  dies.]
[6796.06 - 6799.50] [Negative] [So  my  first  non -OS  SSD  was  quite  recent.]
[6800.80 - 6802.32] [Neutral] [Oh,  interesting.]
[6801.96 - 6805.60] [Neutral] [Um,  man,  I  don't  think  so.]
[6805.78 - 6817.06] [Neutral] [Looking  at  how  kind  of  dead  hard  drives  are  in  the  gaming  space,  I  just  don't  think  too  many  people,  I  mean,  obviously  you're  asking  for  it,  but  I  don't  think  too  many  people  are  at  this  point.]
[6817.38 - 6818.22] [Neutral] [Okay,  are  we  in  the  same  spot?]
[6818.24 - 6821.88] [Neutral] [Yeah,  go  stand  on  that  barrel  on  the  left  and  then  look  right  at  this  pot.]
[6822.04 - 6822.68] [Positive] [I'm  gonna  die.]
[6822.96 - 6823.60] [Very Negative] [No,  I  got  it.]
[6823.60 - 6824.16] [Very Positive] [You  got  him.]
[6824.28 - 6826.14] [Neutral] [Okay,  look  at  the  pot,  okay.]
[6826.14 - 6827.94] [Very Negative] [So  I'm,  dude,  you're  outperforming  me.]
[6828.06 - 6828.88] [Very Negative] [I  am  outperforming  you.]
[6828.88 - 6830.52] [Neutral] [Like  by  a  significant  margin.]
[6830.62 - 6830.92] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[6831.38 - 6838.30] [Negative] [I  guess  non  X3D  may  not  be  the  way  to  go  for  CS2.]
[6838.30 - 6840.60] [Neutral] [Let's  try  something  a  little  more  graphically  demanding.]
[6841.46 - 6843.10] [Positive] [Yes,  I  wish  to  exit  the  game  now.]
[6843.26 - 6844.78] [Neutral] [What  else  did  you  have  in  mind  for  today?]
[6844.88 - 6848.54] [Neutral] [We  can  do  some  Alan  Waite  2  or  we  can  do  some  Cyberpunk  or  both.]
[6848.72 - 6850.12] [Neutral] [Yeah,  let's  fire  up  Cyberpunk.]
[6850.70 - 6852.10] [Positive] [That  seems  like  a  good  place  to  go.]
[6852.20 - 6852.96] [Positive] [Okay,  Dan,  hit  me.]
[6853.10 - 6853.78] [Very Positive] [That's  all  I  got.]
[6853.92 - 6854.76] [Very Positive] [That's  all  you  got.]
[6854.84 - 6855.58] [Very Negative] [Oh,  sick.]
[6855.64 - 6856.28] [Positive] [Okay,  cool.]
[6856.28 - 6858.04] [Neutral] [Well,  we'll  do  Cyberpunk  and  then  we'll  wrap  it  up.]
[6863.28 - 6864.34] [Neutral] [Let's  see.]
[6864.66 - 6866.56] [Neutral] [Actually,  I  don't  even  know  how  many  people  are  watching.]
[6866.56 - 6869.14] [Negative] [I  haven't  so  much  as  looked  at  the  YouTube  dashboard  today.]
[6870.54 - 6876.70] [Negative] [And  it  is  not,  oh,  that's  the  wrong  stream.]
[6876.70 - 6879.60] [Very Positive] [That's  still  the  24  seven  stream.]
[6880.38 - 6881.28] [Neutral] [Oh,  interesting.]
[6881.28 - 6882.42] [Neutral] [Wait,  that  still  exists?]
[6882.66 - 6883.42] [Very Negative] [No,  it  doesn't.]
[6883.58 - 6887.86] [Neutral] [But  the  event  still  does  in  our  event  calendar  or  whatever.]
[6887.80 - 6892.30] [Positive] [The  way  that  you  handle  YouTube  streams  is,  it's  good.]
[6892.46 - 6895.72] [Neutral] [It's  a  lot  better  than  it  was  before,  but  it's  sort  of  unintuitive.]
[6896.12 - 6901.04] [Neutral] [Cause  you  can  either  do  it  like  Twitch  where  you  just  go  live  or  you  can  have  scheduled  events.]
[6902.18 - 6904.46] [Very Positive] [Your  menu's  up  before  me,  mine.]
[6905.98 - 6907.82] [Neutral] [I  mean,  sure.]
[6910.76 - 6913.38] [Negative] [Yeah,  this  wasn't  spec'd  out  as  a  gaming  system.]
[6913.42 - 6913.82] [Very Negative] [No.]
[6914.22 - 6917.52] [Positive] [it's  pretty  darn  good.]
[6918.54 - 6926.34] [Negative] [And  I'm  actually  going  to  lose  some  of  my  advantage  of  having  a  much  more  powerful  GPU  because  we're  running  at  1080p  because  of  our  HDMI  switcher  over  here.]
[6926.82 - 6929.32] [Neutral] [Dan,  is  there  a  reason  that  this  thing  couldn't  do  4K?]
[6929.32 - 6930.26] [Positive] [I  thought  this  thing  does  4K.]
[6930.26 - 6931.04] [Neutral] [It  does  do  4K.]
[6931.08 - 6932.20] [Neutral] [Like,  we  could  try  it.]
[6932.20 - 6932.78] [Neutral] [Oh,  okay.]
[6932.88 - 6936.86] [Negative] [I  don't  feel  like  throwing  a  wrench  in  the  gears.]
[6936.98 - 6937.56] [Neutral] [Tell  you  what.]
[6938.34 - 6940.22] [Neutral] [Let's  do  our  comparison  at  1080p.]
[6940.32 - 6942.20] [Neutral] [Then  we'll  try  and  run  at  4K.]
[6942.06 - 6944.68] [Negative] [and  if  it  doesn't  work,  then  it  doesn't  work.]
[6944.76 - 6948.44] [Positive] [I  think  we  can  do,  yeah,  ray  tracing  overdrive  is  still  going  to  be  challenging  enough  with  no  DLSS.]
[6949.04 - 6950.90] [Very Positive] [Oh,  dude,  ray  tracing  overdrive  will  be  super  challenging.]
[6950.90 - 6952.98] [Very Positive] [I  was  thinking  ray  tracing  ultra,  no  DLSS.]
[6953.98 - 6955.40] [Very Positive] [Ultra,  no  DLSS?]
[6955.44 - 6955.66] [Neutral] [Yeah.]
[6955.66 - 6956.26] [Neutral] [Okay.]
[6956.48 - 6957.16] [Very Negative] [No  frame  gen.]
[6957.92 - 6959.14] [Neutral] [And  then  just  everything  as  it  was.]
[6960.74 - 6961.84] [Neutral] [Windowed  border  list?]
[6963.42 - 6965.26] [Neutral] [Yes,  I  believe  so.]
[6965.90 - 6967.32] [Very Negative] [Oh,  can  we  go  full  screen?]
[6967.38 - 6967.82] [Neutral] [Sure.]
[6968.06 - 6969.88] [Neutral] [I  know  it  doesn't  matter  anymore,  but  whatever.]
[6969.90 - 6970.56] [Neutral] [Yeah,  I  get  that.]
[6970.82 - 6971.30] [Neutral] [Okay.]
[6971.08 - 6972.80] [Negative] [Did  you  put  low  latency?]
[6973.30 - 6974.70] [Very Negative] [Oh,  I  didn't  turn  on  reflex,  I  don't  think.]
[6974.86 - 6975.88] [Neutral] [On  with  boost  enabled?]
[6976.44 - 6976.80] [Neutral] [Sure.]
[6976.92 - 6977.28] [Neutral] [Sure.]
[6977.76 - 6978.94] [Neutral] [Let's  go.]
[6979.10 - 6980.44] [Neutral] [Do  you  want  to  run  the  benchmark  or  just  play?]
[6980.68 - 6981.56] [Very Positive] [Oh,  yeah,  I  want  to  play.]
[6982.00 - 6984.14] [Neutral] [Yeah,  we'll  just  find  a  kind  of  similar -ish  kind  of  area.]
[6984.14 - 6985.58] [Neutral] [We'll  drive  around  or  whatever.]
[6988.04 - 6991.66] [Neutral] [Coffee  Loki  says,  PC  not  good  enough.]
[6993.10 - 6995.16] [Neutral] [I  don't  think  they're  actually  referring  to  these.]
[6995.24 - 6996.32] [Negative] [Spend  more  money.]
[6999.28 - 7001.64] [Neutral] [I'm  going  to  ride  my  3090  until  I  die.]
[7001.74 - 7006.90] [Neutral] [Brandon  the  IT  guy  in  Floatplane  Chat  asks,  is  there  a  Linux  distro  for  video  editing?]
[7007.66 - 7017.10] [Negative] [Not  that  I'm  aware  of,  and  it's  less  to  do  with  the  distro  or  lack  thereof  and  more  to  do  with  the  tools  or  lack  thereof.]
[7017.28 - 7027.06] [Neutral] [Blackmagic  is  doing  a  good  job  of  supporting  it,  but  to  my  knowledge,  none  of  the  other  major  players  in  the  space  have  shown  much  of  an  appetite  for  support  for  Linux.]
[7027.78 - 7029.66] [Neutral] [Are  you  going  to  try  and  get  to  the  exact  same  spot  as  me?]
[7029.68 - 7031.60] [Very Negative] [Because  I  don't  really  think  that's  necessary.]
[7032.82 - 7038.20] [Positive] [Yeah,  I'm  already  outperforming  you  by  a  pretty  significant  margin.]
[7038.20 - 7040.70] [Neutral] [You're  at  like  70  FPS  and  I'm  at  like  90.]
[7041.82 - 7043.10] [Negative] [Oh,  I  dropped  down  a  little  bit.]
[7043.10 - 7043.50] [Negative] [You  dropped  down,  yeah.]
[7043.70 - 7045.94] [Neutral] [But  you're  also  dropped  into  the  60s  now.]
[7046.28 - 7052.92] [Neutral] [I  feel  like  where  you  are  is  harder  to  run  than  where  I  am,  but  I  don't  know  the  map  well  enough  to  be  able  to  get  around.]
[7052.82 - 7057.04] [Positive] [The  3090  to  the  4090  was  a  big  jump  in  performance.]
[7057.50 - 7063.08] [Neutral] [So  if  we  were  looking  at  this  5080  versus  a  4090,  then  it  wouldn't  be  that  impressive.]
[7063.48 - 7075.68] [Positive] [But  looking  at  it  compared  to  the  3090,  you  can  go  from  the  workstation  slash  enthusiast  card  of  that  generation  to  the  gamer  card  of  this  generation  and  expect  a  performance  uplift  honestly.]
[7077.16 - 7078.34] [Negative] [Not  enough  though.]
[7078.18 - 7085.68] [Negative] [if  I  had  a  3090,  I  would  just  run  this  at  75  FPS  rather  than  going  for  the  extra  15  FPS.]
[7085.68 - 7090.52] [Neutral] [I  don't  think  it's  a  big  enough  boost  that  you'll  really  have  a  noticeable  experience.]
[7090.72 - 7100.60] [Neutral] [With  that  said,  if  I  could  get  a  5080  for  MSRP,  knowing  that  I  can  sell  my  3090  for  a  lot,  I  could  probably  almost  do  it  as  a  cross  trade.]
[7100.76 - 7103.72] [Neutral] [So  if  my  priority  was  just  gaming...]
[7104.78 - 7105.36] [Neutral] [It's  true.]
[7105.36 - 7106.48] [Negative] [You  don't  need  that  extra  VRAM.]
[7106.42 - 7109.14] [Neutral] [It  would  be  nice  to  have  that  extra  VRAM,  but...]
[7109.22 - 7112.76] [Negative] [I'd  rather  have  the  raw  performance  than  the  VRAM  at  that  point.]
[7112.76 - 7113.82] [Neutral] [Likewise,  for  gaming.]
[7113.84 - 7114.70] [Very Negative] [For  just  gaming.]
[7114.86 - 7115.58] [Neutral] [Yeah,  I  agree.]
[7115.62 - 7121.36] [Neutral] [And  let  some  AI  tinkerer  have  that  3090  and  use  that  VRAM  for  what  they're  doing.]
[7121.46 - 7121.76] [Neutral] [Yep.]
[7122.44 - 7125.30] [Neutral] [So  that's  a  totally  valid  option.]
[7125.30 - 7129.26] [Very Positive] [I  mean,  both  David  and  I  are  very  PC  of  Theseus  people.]
[7129.70 - 7136.06] [Neutral] [So  we're  always  kind  of  thinking  like,  oh,  what  can  I  sell  from  my  rig  and  then  acquire  and  kind  of  optimize  as  we  go.]
[7135.92 - 7138.22] [Neutral] [but  a  lot  of  people  are  not  like  that.]
[7138.40 - 7142.98] [Very Positive] [So  I  totally  understand  too,  if  you  have  a  3090  and  you're  just  looking  at  your  machine  going,  is  this  still  good  enough?]
[7143.12 - 7144.44] [Neutral] [The  answer  is,  yep.]
[7145.26 - 7146.80] [Neutral] [If  you  don't  feel  like  making  any  changes.]
[7147.10 - 7154.28] [Positive] [But  I've  found  that  kind  of  staying  on  top  of  things  a  little  bit  has  been  the  best  value  way  to  get  the  most  out  of  my  system.]
[7155.34 - 7158.74] [Neutral] [Yeah,  there's  kind  of  a  weird  transition  period  where  the  old  stuff  is  still  really  high  value.]
[7159.40 - 7160.46] [Positive] [Especially  now.]
[7160.46 - 7161.28] [Neutral] [Yeah,  exactly.]
[7161.64 - 7163.14] [Negative] [GPU  transitions  are  so  weird.]
[7164.10 - 7165.90] [Negative] [Not  at  all  like  they  used  to  be.]
[7166.80 - 7169.00] [Positive] [Okay,  I'm  ready  to  try  4K.]
[7169.88 - 7170.62] [Neutral] [What  do  you  think,  Dan?]
[7170.62 - 7171.42] [Neutral] [Is  this  going  to  work?]
[7171.68 - 7172.30] [Neutral] [Yeah,  it  should.]
[7172.36 - 7173.78] [Very Negative] [Oh,  I  can't  even  select  it.]
[7173.78 - 7174.26] [Very Negative] [Oh.]
[7174.60 - 7176.40] [Positive] [You've  got  to  have  your  desktop  set  to  4K.]
[7178.32 - 7179.12] [Neutral] [Or  do  you?]
[7181.16 - 7181.92] [Very Negative] [I  don't  know.]
[7181.98 - 7182.98] [Neutral] [I  didn't  think  so.]
[7183.24 - 7184.20] [Neutral] [Usually  you  can...]
[7184.22 - 7185.02] [Neutral] [Yeah,  I  can't  change  it.]
[7185.10 - 7186.12] [Neutral] [Oh,  maybe  the...]
[7186.40 - 7186.82] [Neutral] [Yep.]
[7187.14 - 7190.60] [Neutral] [Is  there  a  mode  selection  on  this  thing  that's  like...]
[7190.90 - 7192.82] [Neutral] [I  don't  even  know  if  it  is  capable  of  doing  4K.]
[7192.82 - 7193.06] [Neutral] [It  is.]
[7193.06 - 7193.38] [Neutral] [It  is.]
[7193.46 - 7194.72] [Neutral] [It  can  do  8K.]
[7224.50 - 7224.50] [Very Positive] [Oh  dude,  this  will  do  4K  120  hertz.]
[7224.50 - 7224.50] [Neutral] [Yeah,  it's  like  a,  well,  this  is  like  a  high  end  matrix.]
[7224.50 - 7224.50] [Very Negative] [Oh  yeah.]
[7200.00 - 7201.60] [Neutral] [Here,  I'll  fiddle  with  it.]
[7201.82 - 7202.16] [Negative] [Shout  out.]
[7202.28 - 7203.68] [Neutral] [No,  I  don't  think  we  need  to  fiddle  with  it.]
[7203.74 - 7203.92] [Neutral] [It's  okay.]
[7203.92 - 7204.76] [Positive] [AV  Pro  Edge.]
[7204.86 - 7209.46] [Positive] [I  think  what  we're  going  to  do  is,  hey,  hey,  thank  you  guys  very  much  for  tuning  into  the  stream  today.]
[7212.00 - 7221.12] [Neutral] [There's  definitely  some  things  we  like  about  this  configuration,  but  as  you  heard  from  Mark,  our  editing  team  is  very  divided  on  the  subject  of  PC  versus  Mac.]
[7222.04 - 7227.32] [Neutral] [And  if  we  stick  with  PC,  there's  a  chance  that  we're  going  to  end  up  going  50 -90.]
[7227.00 - 7230.58] [Neutral] [Maybe  we'll  do  an  update  on  Floatplane.]
[7230.90 - 7232.80] [Neutral] [We'll  get  you  guys  a  look  at  the  final  system.]
[7233.06 - 7240.52] [Neutral] [Otherwise,  maybe  we'll  do  a  stream  and  we'll  build  a  bunch  of  the  final  systems  and  we'll  hand  deliver  them  to  our  editors  in  the  editing  den  on  the  other  side  of  the  wall.]
[7241.04 - 7242.06] [Very Positive] [See  you  later,  guys!]
