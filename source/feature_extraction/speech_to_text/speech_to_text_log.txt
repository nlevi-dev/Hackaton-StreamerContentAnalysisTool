 Black, I am a Christian squad. And thanks to Black Panther Workstations, I hope your arrows have been watching a lot. It's no progress pass. I've always been thinking about them as big the millions, but the personal landscape has changed a year since 2020 and a year in one month or last to bring improvements to your own circumstances. See? What coming up with our sins is going to destroy all the different issues This is the first time I am going to be able to do this. I am not going to be able to do this. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I was so proud of you. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one? I think too, I suppose. The, the, the present consumer, I suppose. But how should I? Having the food, this one, I suppose. That's... It doesn't consist in the best for a terrible performance. The guy was watching us a pretty blind. I'm going with a test there. Fuck her! I'm a gay man! You, you, you, you, you! The counter-classical works on the way that the Luggeron performance is actually one of M-Tay's last screenreads.

That is very well that the 41300 can and the last behind the scenes
 bar crawl across their screen. And thanks to their dated workstations, our poor editors have been watching a lot of slow progress bars. The only reasonable thing to do then is build them new ones. But the PC landscape has changed a lot since 2021 when we made our last big improvements to our editing stations. So we are teaming up with Asus who sponsored this stream and sent over some awesome parts to try. I like the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which we are not going to use. Did you roll the thing? Yeah. When do I come back? You're back. Oh, in fact, our CPU upgrade might be a little controversial. We're going with the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X. That's right, desktop CPUs, like peasant consumer CPUs. But here's the thing, even without the 3D V-Cache, which doesn't consistently boost productivity performance, the gamers watching this are probably agreeing with our choice going, heck yeah, AMD dominance. But the content creators that are watching might know that video editing performance is actually one of Intel's last strongholds, thanks in part to QuickSync. Now QuickSync, yeah, yeah, let's stand over here. QuickSync is Intel's branding for the dedicated hardware that accelerates video encoding and decoding on their CPUs and their GPUs. And it really does work, allowing Intel to outperform AMD in Adobe Premiere Timeline performance. And actually encoding as well in many cases. That is why we went with their Core i9-13900K in our last behind the scenes.
